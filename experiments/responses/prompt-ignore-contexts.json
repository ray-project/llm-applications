The context provides information on how to configure the batch format and how to transform data using tasks.\n\nTo answer the query, I would suggest using the `batch_format` parameter in the `map_batches` method to specify the desired batch format. For example, to return a batch of NumPy ndarrays, you can set `batch_format=\"numpy\"`. To return a batch of pandas DataFrames, you can set `batch_format=\"pandas\"`.\n\nAdditionally, the context mentions that Ray Data treats returned lists of NumPy ndarrays and objects implementing `__array__` (such as torch.Tensor) as tensor data. Therefore, if you are using a library that returns tensor data, you may need to convert it to a NumPy ndarray or pandas DataFrame before returning it from your function.\n\nFinally, the context provides an example of how to increase the brightness of an image dataset using the `map_batches` method. The example shows how to define a function that takes a batch of images and returns a batch of images with increased brightness. The function is then passed to the `map_batches` method to apply the transformation to the entire dataset.",

The Ray autoscaler is a process that runs on the head node and adjusts the number of nodes in the cluster based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups. When the resource demands of the Ray workload exceed the current capacity of the cluster, the autoscaler will try to increase the number of worker nodes. When worker nodes sit idle, the autoscaler will remove worker nodes from the cluster. Similarly, when Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it will try to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

Instead, you should use `ray.get()` to retrieve the result of a remote task.\n\nUsing `await` to wait for a Ray future can lead to unexpected behavior, such as blocking the event loop or causing deadlocks. This is because Ray futures are not designed to be used with `await`, and they may not be properly integrated with the asyncio event loop.\n\nIf you need to use asyncio with Ray, you should use the `asyncio.wrap_future()` function to convert a Ray future into an asyncio future, and then use `await` to wait for the asyncio future. For example:\n```\nimport asyncio\n\n@ray.remote\ndef some_task():\n    return 1\n\nasync def await_obj_ref():\n    ref = some_task.remote()\n    fut: asyncio.Future = asyncio.wrap_future(ref.future())\n    print(await fut)\n\nasyncio.run(await_obj_ref())\n```\nThis code will correctly retrieve the result of the remote task and print it to the console.",

Make sure that the Ray client is configured to connect to the correct address and port of the Ray cluster.\n3.

It initializes the model and optimizer, and sets the learning rate.\n\nTo use the parameter server in the training loop, you can create an instance of the `ParameterServer` class and pass it to the `train` function:\n```python\nps = ParameterServer.remote(1e-2)\nworkers = [DataWorker.remote() for i in range(num_workers)]\n\nfor epoch in range(num_epochs):\n    for worker in workers:\n        gradients = worker.compute_gradients.remote(ps.get_weights.remote())\n        ps.apply_gradients.remote(gradients)\n        ps.get_weights.remote()\n```\nIn this example, the `ParameterServer` instance `ps` is created and passed to the `train` function. The `train` function iterates over the workers and computes the gradients using the `compute_gradients` method. The gradients are then applied to the model using the `apply_gradients` method of the `ParameterServer`. Finally, the updated weights are retrieved from the `ParameterServer` using the `get_weights` method.\n\nThis is a basic example of how to set up the model to communicate gradient updates across machines using Ray AIR.

The default value is 128 MB, but you can increase it if your model requires more memory.\n\nThe `object_store_memory` parameter specifies the amount of memory to allocate for the object store, which is used to store the model's weights and other data. The default value is 128 MB, but you can increase it if your model requires more memory.\n\nIn general, the amount of memory needed for a model will depend on the size of the model and the amount of data it processes. A good starting point is to use the default values and then adjust them as needed based on the performance of your application.",

This strategy allows you to run multiple workers on different machines, and it will automatically handle the communication and synchronization between the workers.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use this strategy to log the results from multiple workers into a single TensorBoard:\n```\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Define the distributed strategy\nstrategy = tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy()\n\n# Create a TensorBoard writer\nwriter = tf.summary.create_file_writer(\"logs/\")\n\n# Define the training function\n@tf.function\ndef train_step(inputs):\n    # Perform the training step\n    # ...\n    # Log the results to TensorBoard\n    with writer.as_default():\n        tf.summary.scalar(\"loss\", loss, step=tf.summary.experimental.get_step())\n\n# Run the training function on multiple workers\nwith strategy.scope():\n    for i in range(num_workers):\n        train_step(inputs[i])\n```\nIn this example, the `train_step` function is decorated with the `@tf.function` decorator, which allows TensorFlow to compile the function into a graph that can be executed on multiple workers. The `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` is used to create a distributed training environment, and the `tf.summary.create_file_writer` function is used to create a TensorBoard writer that will log the results from all the workers.\n\nTo visualize the results in TensorBoard, you can run the following command:\n```\ntensorboard --logdir logs/\n```\nThis will start TensorBoard and display the results from all the workers in a single dashboard.",

            "answer": "  Based on the context provided, it appears that the user is experiencing issues with deadlocking when using the `sample` API in `ray/rllib/evaluation/rollout_worker.py`. The user has provided a code snippet that shows how they are using the `sample` API, but they have not provided any additional information about the specific error or issue they are experiencing.\n\nWithout more information, it is difficult to provide a specific answer to the user's question. However, I can offer some general advice on how to debug issues with the `sample` API in `ray/rllib/evaluation/rollout_worker.py`.\n\nFirst, it is important to understand that the `sample` API is used to generate samples from a policy. The `sample` API takes a policy and a batch of data as input, and it returns a new batch of data that has been processed by the policy. The `sample` API is typically used in the context of reinforcement learning, where the goal is to learn a policy that can make decisions in an environment.\n\nTo debug issues with the `sample` API, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Check the documentation for the `sample` API to make sure you are using it correctly. The documentation should provide information on the input and output formats for the `sample` API, as well as any specific requirements or constraints that must be met in order to use the API.\n2. Check the error message that you are receiving to see if it provides any clues about what might be going wrong. The error message should provide information on the specific error or issue that is occurring, as well as any additional information that might be helpful in debugging the issue.\n3. Check the code that you are using to see if there are any issues with the way that you are calling the `sample` API. For example, you might be passing in the wrong type of data, or you might be using the API in a way that is not supported.\n4. Try using the `sample` API with a simple example to see if you can reproduce the issue. For example, you might try using the `sample` API with a simple policy and a small batch of data to see if you can get it to work correctly.\n5. If you are still having trouble, you might try contacting the developers of the `ray` library to see if they can provide any additional assistance or guidance. They may be able to provide more information on how to use the `sample` API correctly, or they may be able to help you identify and fix any issues that you are experiencing.",

These options can be set in the Serve config file or on the @serve.deployment decorator. Some of the configurable parameters include the number of replicas, the route prefix, and the user_config.\n\nTo use the user config in Ray Serve, you can set the options in the Serve config file or on the @serve.deployment decorator. For example, to set the number of replicas for a deployment, you can add the following line to the Serve config file:\n```\ndeployments:\n  - name: MyDeployment\n    num_replicas: 3\n```\nAlternatively, you can set the number of replicas using the @serve.deployment decorator:\n```\n@serve.deployment(num_replicas=3)\nclass MyDeployment:\n    ...\n```\nYou can also set the user_config for a deployment by adding a user_config field to the Serve config file or on the @serve.deployment decorator. For example:\n```\ndeployments:\n  - name: MyDeployment\n    user_config:\n      threshold: 1.5\n```\nYou can then access the user_config in your deployment code using the `self.user_config` attribute. For example:\n```\nclass MyDeployment:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.threshold = self.user_config[\"threshold\"]\n```\nNote that the user_config is a dictionary that can contain any key-value pairs that you want to pass to your deployment.

Similarly, the \"SPREAD\" strategy is also a soft policy, meaning that if the bundles cannot be placed on distinct nodes, they will be packed into a single node.\n\nIn addition to \"PACK\" and \"SPREAD\", Ray also supports \"STRICT_PACK\" and \"STRICT_SPREAD\" strategies, which are more strict versions of the \"PACK\" and \"SPREAD\" strategies, respectively.

This is because each actor can handle one key at a time, and having multiple keys per actor can lead to contention and reduced performance.\n\nIn the context of the provided code, it is recommended to create a separate actor for each key in the dataset. This will allow for better parallelization and improved performance.\n\nIt is also important to note that the number of actors should be determined based on the available resources in the cluster, and not by the number of keys in the dataset. The number of actors should be set to the number of CPUs or GPUs available in the cluster, or a multiple of that number. This will ensure that the actors are able to make use of the available resources and perform optimally.",

Unique name: A named actor can be given a unique name within its namespace, which allows you to retrieve the actor from any job in the Ray cluster.\n2. Easy retrieval: You can retrieve the actor later somewhere else in the code by using the `ray.get_actor()` method and passing in the name of the actor.\n3. Garbage collection: The actor will still be garbage-collected if no handles to it exist, even if it has a name.\n4. Non-global named actors: In C++, you can create non-global named actors that are only valid within the job and cannot be accessed from another job.\n5. Sync call: The `ray.get_actor()` method is a sync call and will timeout after 60s if the named actor does not exist.\n6. Namespace support: Named actors are scoped by namespace, and if no namespace is assigned, they will be placed in an anonymous namespace by default.\n7. Global name: You can create an actor with a globally unique name using the `ray::Actor(CreateCounter).SetGlobalName(\"some_name\").Remote()` method in C++.\n8. Detached actors: You can create detached actors that live as global objects independent of the creator using the `ray::Actor(CreateCounter).SetGlobalName(\"some_name\").Remote()` method in C++.\n9. Better performance: Using named actors can provide better performance than using tasks, especially when the actor has a large state.\n\nIt's worth noting that if you don't need the stateful part of an actor, you're mostly better off using tasks.",

            "answer": "  To make a Ray Tune trial retry on failures, you can use the `FailureConfig` class in Ray Tune. This class allows you to configure the behavior of the trial when it fails, including whether to retry the trial or not.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `FailureConfig` to make a trial retry on failures:\n```\nfrom ray import tune\n\n# Define the trial\ndef train_model(config):\n    # Train the model\n    pass\n\n# Define the failure configuration\nfailure_config = tune.FailureConfig(\n    retry_count=3,  # Retry the trial up to 3 times\n    retry_delay=60,  # Wait 60 seconds before retrying\n    retry_on_failure=True  # Retry the trial on failure\n)\n\n# Run the trial with Tune\ntuner = tune.Tuner(train_model, param_space=trial_space, failure_config=failure_config)\nresults = tuner.fit()\n```\nIn this example, the `FailureConfig` class is used to configure the trial to retry up to 3 times with a delay of 60 seconds between retries. The `retry_on_failure` parameter is set to `True` to enable retries on failure.\n\nYou can also use the `on_trial_error` and `on_trial_recover` callbacks in Ray Tune to handle trial failures and retries. These callbacks are called when a trial fails or is recovered, respectively. You can use these callbacks to implement custom logic for handling trial failures and retries.\n\nFor example, you can use the `on_trial_error` callback to log the failure and the `on_trial_recover` callback to log the recovery. Here is an example of how to use these callbacks:\n```\nfrom ray import tune\n\n# Define the trial\ndef train_model(config):\n    # Train the model\n    pass\n\n# Define the failure configuration\nfailure_config = tune.FailureConfig(\n    retry_count=3,  # Retry the trial up to 3 times\n    retry_delay=60,  # Wait 60 seconds before retrying\n    retry_on_failure=True  # Retry the trial on failure\n)\n\n# Define the callbacks\ndef on_trial_error(iteration, trials, trial, **info):\n    # Log the failure\n    print(f\"Trial {trial.trial_id} failed at iteration {iteration}\")\n\ndef on_trial_recover(iteration, trials, trial, **info):\n    # Log the recovery\n    print(f\"Trial {trial.trial_id} recovered at iteration {iteration}\")\n\n# Run the trial with Tune\ntuner = tune.Tuner(train_model, param_space=trial_space, failure_config=failure_config,\n                   on_trial_error=on_trial_error, on_trial_recover=on_trial_recover)\nresults = tuner.fit()\n```\nIn this example, the `on_trial_error` callback is called when a trial fails, and the `on_trial_recover` callback is called when a trial is recovered. These callbacks log the failure and recovery, respectively.",

The `read_text()` function is a convenient way to read text data into a Ray dataset, but it may not be the most efficient way to read large amounts of text data. If you need to read large amounts of text data, you may want to consider using a more specialized library such as `pandas` or `spark`.",

For example:\n```\nconfig = TuneConfig(num_samples=100, max_concurrent_trials=10, resources={\"cpu\": 1, \"memory\": 1024})\n```\nThis will set the memory limit for each trial to 1024 MB and the maximum number of concurrent trials to 10.\n\nNote that the `resources` parameter in `tune.with_resources` and the `resources` field in `TuneConfig` are used to specify the resources required for each trial, not the memory limit.

By default, this will send a `KeyboardInterrupt` to the task's worker if it is mid-execution. You can also pass in the `force=True` argument to force-exit the worker.\n\nHere is an example of how to cancel a Ray task:\n```\n@ray.remote\ndef my_task():\n    # Do some work\n    return \"Task completed\"\n\n# Start the task\ntask_ref = my_task.remote()\n\n# Cancel the task\nray.cancel(task_ref)\n```\nNote that currently, Ray will not automatically retry tasks that have been cancelled. If you want to retry a task that has been cancelled, you will need to create a new task and pass in the same arguments as the original task.\n\nAlso, note that cancelling a task does not guarantee that the task will be cancelled. If the cancellation request doesn't get through to the executor, the task might not be cancelled. You can check if a task was successfully cancelled using `ray.get(task_ref)`.",

To resolve this issue, you can try the following:\n\n1. Use `ray.put()` to put the large object in the Ray object store, and then pass the object reference to the actor.\n2. Use the `ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy` to create a pool of actors that can be reused for multiple tasks, which can help reduce the overhead of creating and destroying actors.\n3. Use the `reuse_actors` option in `tune.TuneConfig()` to reuse actors across multiple trials, which can help reduce the overhead of creating and destroying actors.\n4. Use the `ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy` with the `max_size` parameter set to a larger value, to allow more actors to be created.\n5. Use the `ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy` with the `min_size` parameter set to a smaller value, to allow fewer actors to be created.\n6. Use the `ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy` with the `num_gpus` parameter set to a larger value, to allow more GPUs to be used.\n7. Use the `ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy` with the `num_cpus` parameter set to a larger value, to allow more CPUs to be used.\n8.

If the client disconnects unexpectedly, i.e. due to a network failure, the client will attempt to reconnect to the server for 30 seconds before all of the references are dropped.

Ray Data provides a simple and efficient way to perform batch inference with pre-trained models, including PyTorch and TensorFlow models.\n\nTo use Ray Data for batch inference, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Load your dataset into a Ray Dataset.\n2. Preprocess the data as needed for your model.\n3. Use the Ray Data `map_batches` method to parallelize the inference across multiple GPU workers.\n4. Evaluate the predictions and save the results to an external storage.\n\nHere's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use Ray Data for batch inference with a pre-trained PyTorch model:\n```python\nimport ray\nfrom ray.data import from_numpy\nfrom ray.data.dataset import Dataset\nfrom ray.data.batch import Batch\nfrom ray.data.batch_inference import BatchInference\nfrom ray.data.batch_inference.pytorch import PyTorchBatchInference\n\n# Load the dataset into a Ray Dataset\nds = from_numpy(np.asarray([\"Complete this\", \"for me\"]))\n\n# Preprocess the data as needed for your model\ndef preprocess(row):\n    # Add any preprocessing steps here\n    return row\n\nds = ds.map(preprocess)\n\n# Load the pre-trained PyTorch model\nmodel = torch.load(\"model.pth\")\n\n# Define a callable class that sets up and invokes the model\nclass PyTorchPredictor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.model = model\n\n    def __call__(self, batch: Batch) -> Batch:\n        # Get the predictions from the input batch\n        return self.model(batch)\n\n# Use Ray Data to perform batch inference\nbatch_inference = PyTorchBatchInference(ds, PyTorchPredictor())\n\n# Evaluate the predictions and save the results to an external storage\nresults = batch_inference.evaluate()\n```\nIn this example, we first load the dataset into a Ray Dataset and preprocess the data as needed for our model. We then load the pre-trained PyTorch model and define a callable class that sets up and invokes the model. Finally, we use Ray Data to perform batch inference and evaluate the predictions, saving the results to an external storage.\n\nNote that this is just a simple example, and you may need to modify the code to fit your specific use case. Additionally, you can use other libraries like TensorFlow or Hugging Face Transformers to perform batch inference with PyTorch models.",

This function takes a list of tensors as input and performs an all-reduce operation on each tensor in the list.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `allreduce()` to perform an all-reduce operation among a list of actors:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Create a list of actors\nactors = [ray.remote(num_gpus=1) for i in range(5)]\n\n# Create a list of tensors to be all-reduced\ntensor_list = [torch.ones((10,), dtype=torch.float32) for i in range(5)]\n\n# Perform the all-reduce operation\nray.util.collective.collective.allreduce(tensor_list, \"default\")\n```\nIn this example, we create a list of five actors, each with one GPU, and a list of five tensors to be all-reduced. We then use the `allreduce()` function to perform the all-reduce operation on each tensor in the list. The `allreduce()` function takes the list of tensors as input and performs the all-reduce operation on each tensor in parallel.\n\nNote that the `allreduce()` function assumes that the tensors in the list are located on different GPUs. If the tensors are located on the same GPU, you can use the `ray.util.collective.collective.reduce()` function instead, which performs a reduce operation on a single tensor.",

You can also use the `ray.is_initialized()` function to check if Ray has been initialized.\n\nHere is an example of how you can write a unit test for a Ray program using the `unittest` module:\n```\nimport unittest\nimport ray\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        ray.shutdown()\n\n    def test_ray_program(self):\n        # Test your Ray program here\n        pass\n```\nYou can also use the `ray.cluster_utils.Cluster` class to create a mini-cluster for testing.\n\nIt's also important to note that Ray programs can be a little tricky to test due to the nature of parallel programs.

To use async.io with Ray, you can define an actor with async methods, and then use the `ray.get()` method to retrieve the results of the async operations.\n\nHere is an example of how to use async.io with Ray:\n```\nimport ray\nimport asyncio\n\n@ray.remote\nclass AsyncActor:\n    async def run_task(self):\n        print(\"started\")\n        await asyncio.sleep(2) # Network, I/O task here\n        print(\"ended\")\n\nactor = AsyncActor.remote()\n\n# regular ray.get\nray.get([actor.run_task.remote() for _ in range(4)])\n```\nIn this example, the `AsyncActor` class is defined with an async method `run_task`. The `ray.get()` method is used to retrieve the results of the async operations.\n\nIt's also possible to use `ray.wait()` to wait for the results of the async operations, which can be useful if you want to process the results as they become available.\n```\nimport ray\nimport asyncio\n\n@ray.remote\nclass AsyncActor:\n    async def run_task(self):\n        print(\"started\")\n        await asyncio.sleep(2) # Network, I/O task here\n        print(\"ended\")\n\nactor = AsyncActor.remote()\n\n# async ray.get\nasync def async_get():\n    await actor.run_task.remote()\n\nasyncio.run(async_get())\n```\nIt's important to note that when using async.io with Ray, the `ray.get()` method will block until the results of the async operations are available. This can be a problem if you want to process the results as they become available, in which case you should use `ray.wait()` instead.",

For example:\n```\nimport ray\n\nreplica_handle = ray.get_actor(\"SERVE_REPLICA::SleepyPid#RlRptP\", namespace=\"serve\")\nray.kill(replica_handle, no_restart=True)\n```\nThis will kill the replica actor and prevent it from restarting. If you want to kill the actor but allow it to restart, you can pass `no_restart=False` to `ray.kill`.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `ray.actor.exit_actor` function to manually terminate the actor from within one of its methods.

The `do_something()` method is defined as a method of the `CustomModule` class.\n\nTo push the `CustomModule` actor into the actor pool, we use the `push()` method of the `ActorPool` class. The `push()` method takes an actor as an argument, so we pass in the `CustomModule.remote()` actor.\n\nOnce the `CustomModule` actor is pushed into the actor pool, it can be used by other actors in the pool. For example, we can create another actor that uses the `CustomModule` actor:\n```\n@ray.remote\nclass AnotherActor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def use_custom_module(self):\n        # Get a handle to the CustomModule actor\n        custom_module = ray.get_actor(\"CustomModule\")\n\n        # Call the do_something() method of the CustomModule actor\n        custom_module.do_something.remote()\n```\nIn this example, the `AnotherActor` class is defined as a remote actor using the `@ray.remote` decorator. The `use_custom_module()` method is defined as a method of the `AnotherActor` class.\n\nInside the `use_custom_module()` method, we use the `ray.get_actor()` method to get a handle to the `CustomModule` actor. We then call the `do_something()` method of the `CustomModule` actor using the `remote()` method.\n\nBy pushing the `CustomModule` actor into the actor pool using the `ray.util.ActorPool.push()` method, we can use the `CustomModule` actor in other actors in the pool.",

It also mentions that the Logs view in the Dashboard lists the Ray logs in the cluster, organized by node and log file name.\n\nBased on this information, it is likely that the user is not seeing log.info in the Ray log because the log level is not set to INFO. By default, Ray loggers are set to logging.INFO, but this can be modified by specifying the appropriate logger name.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the user can try setting the log level to INFO by modifying the Ray logger configuration.

This function takes in the number of CPUs and bundles (a list of resource requirements) as arguments, and will immediately attempt to scale the cluster to accommodate the requested resources.\n\nHere is an example of how to use this function to scale up a cluster:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Connect to the Ray cluster\nray.init()\n\n# Request additional resources\nray.autoscaler.sdk.request_resources(num_cpus=10, bundles=[{\"CPU\": 2, \"GPU\": 1}])\n```\nThis will request 10 CPUs and 1 GPU for the cluster. The autoscaler will immediately attempt to scale the cluster to accommodate the requested resources, bypassing normal upscaling speed constraints.\n\nYou can also use the `ray up` command to scale up a cluster. This command takes in a cluster configuration file as an argument, and will create or update a Ray cluster based on the configuration. You can use the `--min-workers` and `--max-workers` options to override the configured min and max worker node counts for the cluster.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `ray up` command to scale up a cluster:\n```\nray up --min-workers 10 --max-workers 20 my_cluster_config.yaml\n```\nThis will create or update a Ray cluster with a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 20 worker nodes, based on the configuration in the `my_cluster_config.yaml` file.",

By default, logs are emitted from actors both to stderr and on disk on each node at /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/. This includes both system-level logs from the Serve controller and proxy as well as access logs and custom user logs produced from within deployment replicas.\n\nTherefore, to find HTTP server error code logs for Ray Serve, you can check the logs located at /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/ on each node in the Ray cluster.

The GCS is not fault tolerant by default, as all data is stored in-memory and its failure means the entire Ray cluster fails. To make the GCS fault tolerant, HA Redis is required.\n\nThe head node has more memory-demanding system components such as GCS or the dashboard. Also, the driver runs from a head node by default. If the head node has the same memory capacity as worker nodes and if you execute the same number of Tasks and Actors from a head node, it can easily have out-of-memory problems. In this case, do not run any Tasks and Actors on the head node by specifying --num-cpus=0 when starting a head node by ray start --head.\n\nWhen deploying a large cluster, Ray\u2019s architecture means that the head node has extra stress due to additional system processes running on it like GCS. A good starting hardware specification for the head node is 8 CPUs and 32 GB memory. The actual hardware specification depends on the workload and the size of the cluster. Metrics that are useful for deciding the hardware specification are CPU usage, memory usage, and network bandwidth usage. Make sure the head node has sufficient bandwidth. The most heavily stressed resource on the head node is outbound bandwidth.\n\nTuning Operating System Settings: Because all nodes and workers connect to the GCS, many network connections will be created and the operating system has to support that number of connections.\n\nHead node recovery: Ray GCS fault tolerance: You must deploy your Serve application with KubeRay to use this feature. See Serve\u2019s Kubernetes production guide to learn how you can deploy your app with KubeRay. In this section, you\u2019ll learn how to add fault tolerance to Ray\u2019s Global Control Store (GCS), which allows your Serve application to serve traffic even when the head node crashes. By default, the Ray head node is a single point of failure: if it crashes, the entire Ray cluster crashes and must be restarted.

To debug this issue, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Check the Ray status using the command `ray status`. This will give you an overview of the cluster's current state, including the number of nodes, their status, and any recent failures.\n2. Check the autoscaler monitor log by running `cat /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/monitor.*`. This will provide more detailed information about the cluster's autoscaling behavior and any issues that may be occurring.\n3. Check the Ray cluster's events using the command `kubectl describe pod raycluster-kuberay-xxxx-xxxxx`. This will give you information about any errors that may have occurred during the cluster's creation or scaling process.\n4. Check the Docker resource limits on your cluster to ensure that they are set high enough to accommodate the Ray cluster's needs.\n5. Consider creating fewer actors or adding more nodes to the Ray cluster to free up resources and allow the Dataset job to run.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and address the root cause of the issue with your Ray cluster.",

            "answer": "  To get more detailed errors or logs from Ray Serve, you can use the following mechanisms:\n\n1. Catching application-level failures: Ray surfaces application-level failures as Python-level exceptions. When a task on a remote worker or actor fails due to a Python-level exception, Ray wraps the original exception in a RayTaskError and stores this as the task\u2019s return value. This wrapped exception will be thrown to any worker that tries to get the result, either by calling ray.get or if the worker is executing another task that depends on the object.\n2. Ray logging: Ray Serve uses Python\u2019s standard logging module with a logger named \"ray.serve\". By default, logs are emitted from actors both to stderr and on disk on each node at /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/. This includes both system-level logs from the Serve controller and proxy as well as access logs and custom user logs produced from within deployment replicas. In development, logs are streamed to the driver Ray program (the Python script that calls serve.run() or the serve run CLI command), so it\u2019s convenient to keep the driver running while debugging.\n3. Fault tolerance: Ray provides mechanisms to catch errors, retry failed code, and handle misbehaving code. See the pages for task and actor fault tolerance for more information on these mechanisms.\n4. ray.exceptions.ObjectReconstructionFailedLineageEvictedError: Indicates that the object cannot be reconstructed because its lineage was evicted due to memory pressure.\n5. ray.exceptions.RuntimeEnvSetupError: Raised when a runtime environment fails to be set up.\n6. ray.exceptions.CrossLanguageError: Raised from another language.\n7. ray.exceptions.RaySystemError: Indicates that Ray encountered a system error. This exception can be thrown when the raylet is killed.\n\nIt's important to note that Ray Serve is a distributed system, and that means failures can happen. Generally, failures can be classified into two classes: 1) application-level failures, and 2) system-level failures. The former can happen because of bugs in user-level code, or if external systems fail. The latter can be triggered by node failures, network failures, or just bugs in Ray.",

            "answer": "  To track an uncaught exception in Ray Serve, you can use the `ray.exceptions` module. Specifically, you can use the `RaySystemError` exception to catch and handle uncaught exceptions.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use `RaySystemError` to catch and handle uncaught exceptions in Ray Serve:\n```\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\ndef my_function():\n    try:\n        # Your code here\n    except ray.exceptions.RaySystemError as e:\n        # Handle the exception here\n        print(f\"RaySystemError: {e}\")\n```\nIn this example, the `my_function` function is decorated with the `@ray.remote` decorator, which allows it to be executed remotely on a Ray cluster. The `try` block contains the code that you want to execute, and the `except` block catches any uncaught exceptions that occur during the execution of the code. In this case, the `except` block catches `RaySystemError` exceptions and prints a message indicating that an uncaught exception occurred.\n\nYou can also use other exceptions in the `ray.exceptions` module to catch and handle specific types of uncaught exceptions. For example, you can use `ray.exceptions.ObjectReconstructionFailedError` to catch and handle exceptions related to object reconstruction, or `ray.exceptions.RuntimeEnvSetupError` to catch and handle exceptions related to setting up the runtime environment.\n\nIt's important to note that uncaught exceptions in Ray Serve can be caused by a variety of factors, including network errors, node failures, and system errors. By using the `ray.exceptions` module to catch and handle uncaught exceptions, you can help ensure that your Ray Serve application is more robust and can recover from unexpected errors.",

You can also use the `--glob` flag to filter the logs by a specific file name or pattern. For example, to view the logs from a file named `serve.log`, you can run the following command:\n```\nray logs --node-id <NODE_ID> --glob serve.log\n```\nAlternatively, you can use the `ray.util.state.list_logs()` function to list the available log files on a node, and then use the `ray.util.state.get_log()` function to retrieve the contents of a specific log file. For example:\n```\nfrom ray.util.state import list_logs, get_log\n\n# List the available log files on a node\nlogs = list_logs(node_id=<NODE_ID>)\n\n# Retrieve the contents of a specific log file\nlog_file = logs[0]\nlog_contents = get_log(log_file)\n```\nNote that the `ray logs` command and the `ray.util.state.list_logs()` and `ray.util.state.get_log()` functions are only available in the Ray dashboard, and not in the Ray CLI.",

We submit the task to Ray using the `remote` method and store the resulting object reference in the `task` variable. We then cancel the task using the `cancel` function and resubmit the task using the `remote` method again. Finally, we get the result of the task using the `get` function and print it to the console.\n\nNote that canceled tasks may not be retried automatically, so you will need to resubmit the task manually if you want to rerun it.

The experiences are stored in a `SampleBatchBuilder` object, which is then converted to a `SampleBatch` object using the `build_and_reset` method.

If the head node has the same memory capacity as worker nodes and if you execute the same number of Tasks and Actors from a head node, it can easily have out-of-memory problems.\n\nInstead, you should allocate object store memory based on the available memory on each node, and make sure that the head node has more memory available than the worker nodes. You can do this by specifying the `object_store_memory` parameter when starting the Ray cluster, and setting it to a value that is appropriate for the head node. For example:\n```\nray start --object-store-memory=200000000 --memory 200000000 --num-cpus=1 --address=$RAY_HEAD_ADDRESS:6379 --block; ray stop\n```\nThis will start the Ray cluster with 2GB of object store memory on the head node, and 2GB of memory for the worker nodes.

Use client-side retries to retry requests that time out due to transient failures.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttp_options:\n  request_timeout_s: 30\n```\nThis sets the end-to-end timeout for HTTP requests to 30 seconds.\n\nNote that the `request_timeout_s` field is only available in Ray Serve 1.10.0 and later versions. In earlier versions of Ray Serve, you can set the `request_timeout_s` field in the `HTTPOptions` field of the Serve config, but it will not have any effect.",

The runtime environment is a Python dictionary that can be used to specify configuration options for a job, task, or actor.\n\nHere are some examples of how to use the `--runtime-env-json` option:\n\n1. To specify a runtime environment for a Ray job, you can use the `ray.init()` function and pass the runtime environment as an argument:\n```\nray.init(runtime_env=RuntimeEnv(...))\n```\n2. To specify a runtime environment for a Ray task or actor, you can use the `@ray.remote` decorator and pass the runtime environment as an argument:\n```\n@ray.remote(runtime_env=RuntimeEnv(...))\ndef my_task():\n    ...\n```\n3. To specify a runtime environment for a Ray application using Ray Client, you can use the `ray.client.init()` function and pass the runtime environment as an argument:\n```\nray.client.init(runtime_env=RuntimeEnv(...))\n```\n4. To specify a runtime environment for a Ray application using Ray Job submission, you can use the `ray.job.submit()` function and pass the runtime environment as an argument:\n```\nray.job.submit(runtime_env=RuntimeEnv(...))\n```\nThe runtime environment can be specified using a Python dictionary or a `ray.runtime_env.RuntimeEnv` object. The dictionary should contain the following keys:\n\n* `pip`: A list of Python packages to install using `pip`.\n* `env_vars`: A dictionary of environment variables to set.\n* `working_dir`: The working directory for the application.\n\nHere is an example of a runtime environment dictionary:\n```\nruntime_env = {\n    \"pip\": [\"requests\", \"chess\"],\n    \"env_vars\": {\"MY_ENV_VAR\": \"my-value\"},\n    \"working_dir\": \"./project/src\"\n}\n```\nYou can also use the `ray.runtime_env.RuntimeEnv` class to define a runtime environment. This class takes the same arguments as the dictionary, but it provides more flexibility and can be used to define more complex dependencies.\n\nHere is an example of a runtime environment using the `ray.runtime_env.RuntimeEnv` class:\n```\nfrom ray.runtime_env import RuntimeEnv\n\nruntime_env = RuntimeEnv(\n    pip=[\"requests\", \"chess\"],\n    env_vars={\"MY_ENV_VAR\": \"my-value\"},\n    working_dir=\"./project/src\"\n)\n```\nYou can also specify the runtime environment using a YAML file. This can be useful for more complex dependencies, such as files outside the working directory, environment variables, and Python packages.\n\nHere is an example of a YAML file for a runtime environment:\n```\nruntime_env:\n  pip:\n    - requests\n    - chess\n  env_vars:\n    MY_ENV_VAR: my-value\n  working_dir: ./project/src\n```\nYou can then pass the YAML file to the `ray.init()` function or the `ray.job.submit()` function to specify the runtime environment for your Ray application.",

Insufficient resources: If the cluster is running low on resources, such as CPU or memory, it can lead to spikes in CPU utilization as nodes compete for available resources.\n2. Autoscaling: Ray's autoscaling feature can add or remove nodes from the cluster based on resource demands. This can lead to spikes in CPU utilization as new nodes are added to the cluster to handle increased workload.\n3. Preprocessing compute time: If the preprocessing step of a workload is computationally intensive, adding more CPU-only nodes can further parallelize preprocessing and lead to spikes in CPU utilization.\n4. Memory usage: If a node runs low on memory, Ray may kill a task to free up resources, which can lead to spikes in CPU utilization as the task is restarted on a different node.\n5. Network bandwidth usage: If the network bandwidth is insufficient, it can lead to spikes in CPU utilization as nodes compete for available bandwidth.\n\nTo address these issues, it is important to monitor the resource usage of the cluster and adjust the configuration as needed to ensure that there are sufficient resources available to handle the workload. Additionally, optimizing the workload and using more efficient algorithms can help reduce the load on the cluster and prevent spikes in CPU utilization.",

The `JobSubmissionClient` class in the Python SDK provides a `get_job_info` method that returns a `JobDetails` object, which includes a `dashboard_url` field that contains the link to the dashboard for the job.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `get_job_info` method to get the dashboard URL for a job:\n```\nfrom ray.job_submission import JobSubmissionClient\n\n# Initialize the client\nclient = JobSubmissionClient(\"http://127.0.0.1:8265\")\n\n# Submit a job\nsubmission_id = client.submit_job(entrypoint=\"sleep 1\")\n\n# Get the job info\njob_info = client.get_job_info(submission_id)\n\n# Print the dashboard URL\nprint(job_info.dashboard_url)\n```\nThis will print the URL for the dashboard for the job with the specified `submission_id`.",

Adjust the local disk utilization threshold: You can adjust the threshold for local disk utilization to prevent running out of disk space.\n5. Use a large buffer size for HDDs: If you are using an HDD, it is recommended to specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling.\n\nBy using these strategies, you can help ensure that objects are spilled to external storage when necessary, and that the performance penalty associated with object spilling is minimized.",
