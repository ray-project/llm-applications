The number of replicas can be scaled up or down (or even autoscaled) to match the incoming request load.

        "score": 5.0,

        "question": "how can I avoid objects not getting spilled?",
        "source": "https://docs.ray.io/en/master/ray-core/objects/object-spilling.html#single-node",
        "answer": "To avoid objects not getting spilled, you can configure the directory where objects are spilled to by using the `object_spilling_config` parameter in the `ray.init` function. You can also specify multiple directories to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices. Additionally, you can adjust the buffer size to reduce IO requests during spilling. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended to specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage by using the `smart_open` parameter in the `object_spilling_config` parameter.",
        "score": 5.0,
        "reasoning": "This answer provides a comprehensive solution to the problem by explaining how to configure the directory where objects are spilled to, how to specify multiple directories, how to adjust the buffer size, and how to enable object spilling to remote storage. It also provides additional recommendations for optimizing performance."

        "reasoning": "This function takes in a variety of parameters that allow the user to customize the reading of image files. It allows for the specification of a filesystem, parallelism, and a meta provider, as well as the ability to filter by file extension and include paths. Additionally, it supports reading images from a variety of sources, including S3 and local files. For these reasons, it is a versatile and powerful function that can handle a wide range of image reading tasks, earning it a score of 5."
