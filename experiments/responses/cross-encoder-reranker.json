The Ray autoscaler is responsible for scaling up or down the number of worker nodes in the cluster based on the resource demands of the Ray workload. The Ray Serve autoscaler sits on top of the Ray Autoscaler and asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If the Ray Autoscaler determines there aren't enough available CPUs to place these actors, it responds by requesting more Ray nodes. The underlying cloud provider will then respond by adding more nodes.\n\nThe autoscaling algorithm takes into consideration several user-specified parameters, such as min_replicas, which is the minimum number of replicas for the deployment. The autoscaler also considers logical resource requests for scaling, such as those specified in @ray.remote and displayed in ray status, not physical machine utilization. If a user tries to launch an actor, task, or placement group but there are insufficient resources, the request will be queued. The autoscaler adds nodes to satisfy resource demands in this queue.",

The function takes an `id` parameter that specifies the node you want to get the address for, and an optional `address` parameter that specifies the Ray bootstrap address. If the `address` parameter is not provided, it will be retrieved from the initialized Ray cluster.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `get_node` function to get the address of a Ray node:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Get the address of the head node\nhead_node_address = ray.util.state.get_node(id=\"head\")\n\n# Get the address of a worker node\nworker_node_address = ray.util.state.get_node(id=\"worker\")\n```\nNote that the `get_node` function returns a `NodeState` object, which contains information about the node, including its address. You can access the address of the node by using the `address` attribute of the `NodeState` object.",

By default, Ray tasks require 1 CPU each and Ray actors require 0 CPU each, so the scheduler limits task concurrency to the available CPUs and actor concurrency to infinite. Tasks that use more than 1 CPU (e.g., via multithreading) may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones, but otherwise are safe to run. However, tasks or actors that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM.",

For example:\n```\n@ray.remote(scheduling_strategy=\"SPREAD\")\ndef my_actor():\n    # Do some work\n    pass\n```\nThis will spread the actors across the cluster, so that each node has at least one actor running on it.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `ray.util.ActorPool` class to create a pool of actors that will be spread across the cluster. For example:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Create a pool of 10 actors\nactors = ray.util.ActorPool(10)\n\n# Spread the actors across the cluster\nactors.spread()\n```\nThis will create a pool of 10 actors and spread them across the cluster, so that each node has at least one actor running on it.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.nodes()` function to get a list of the nodes in the cluster, and then use the `ray.available_resources()` function to get the available resources on each node. This can help you determine how to spread the actors across the cluster.\n\nFor example:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Get a list of the nodes in the cluster\nnodes = ray.nodes()\n\n# Get the available resources on each node\navailable_resources = ray.available_resources()\n\n# Spread the actors across the cluster\nfor node in nodes:\n    # Get the available resources on this node\n    node_resources = available_resources[node]\n\n    # Spread the actors across the node\n    for i in range(node_resources[\"CPU\"]):\n        # Create an actor on this node\n        actor = my_actor.options(num_cpus=1).remote()\n\n        # Spread the actor across the node\n        actor.spread()\n```\nThis will create a pool of actors and spread them across the cluster, so that each node has at least one actor running on it.

This method allows you to report intermediate results and checkpoints from the training function (run on distributed workers) up to the Trainer (where your python script is executed). The results will be collected from the distributed workers and passed to the driver to be logged and displayed.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use `train.report()` to log the results from multiple distributed workers into a single tensorboard:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.train import Trainer\n\n# Define your training function\ndef train_func():\n    # ...\n    # Report intermediate results and checkpoints\n    train.report(metrics={\"loss\": loss, \"accuracy\": accuracy})\n    # ...\n\n# Create a Trainer object\ntrainer = Trainer(backend=\"tensorflow\", num_workers=2)\n\n# Train the model\ntrainer.run(train_func)\n```\nIn this example, the `train_func()` function is executed on two workers, and the `train.report()` method is used to report the intermediate results and checkpoints from both workers to the Trainer. The Trainer then logs the results to a single tensorboard.\n\nNote that only the results from rank 0 worker will be used. However, in order to ensure consistency, `train.report()` has to be called on each worker. If you want to aggregate results from multiple workers, you can use the `train.report_aggregated()` method instead.",

This class is used to perform rollouts in RLlib, and it appears that the `sample()` method is causing the deadlock.\n\nThe `sample()` method is used to collect samples from the environment, and it is called by the `learn_on_batch()` method. The `learn_on_batch()` method is used to train the policy on a batch of samples.\n\nThe deadlock is likely caused by a synchronization issue between the `sample()` method and the `learn_on_batch()` method. It's possible that the `sample()` method is waiting for the `learn_on_batch()` method to complete, while the `learn_on_batch()` method is waiting for the `sample()` method to complete.\n\nTo resolve the issue, you can try the following:\n\n1. Check the `ray.rllib.evaluation.rollout_worker.RolloutWorker` class to see if there are any synchronization issues between the `sample()` method and the `learn_on_batch()` method.\n2. Check the `ray.rllib.evaluation.sampler.SyncSampler` class to see if there are any issues with the synchronization of the `sample()` method.\n3. Check the `ray.rllib.evaluation.worker_set.WorkerSet` class to see if there are any issues with the synchronization of the `foreach_worker_async()` method.\n4. Check the `ray.rllib.algorithms.pg.pg_tf_policy.PGTF1Policy` class to see if there are any issues with the policy.\n5. Check the `ray.rllib.utils.from_config.AlgorithmConfig` class to see if there are any issues with the configuration.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, you can try using the `ray.rllib.utils.debugging.pdb` module to debug the issue. This module provides a debugger that can be used to step through the code and identify the source of the deadlock.",

You can then use the `checkpoint` object to save the model to a file or upload it to a cloud storage service.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `from_state_dict` method to create a checkpoint from a state dictionary. This can be useful if you want to save the model's state dictionary to a file or upload it to a cloud storage service without creating a checkpoint object.\n\nHere's an example:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.train import Checkpoint\n\n# Create a PyTorch model\nmodel = ...\n\n# Create a state dictionary from the model\nstate_dict = model.state_dict()\n\n# Create a checkpoint from the state dictionary\ncheckpoint = Checkpoint.from_state_dict(state_dict)\n```\nI hope this helps!

A deployment contains business logic or an ML model to handle incoming requests and can be scaled up to run across a Ray cluster. At runtime, a deployment consists of a number of replicas, which are individual copies of the class or function that are started in separate Ray Actors (processes). The number of replicas can be scaled up or down (or even autoscaled) to match the incoming request load. To define a deployment, use the @serve.deployment decorator on a Python class (or function for simple use cases). Then, bind the deployment with optional arguments to the constructor (see below).",

This configuration can include things like the number of replicas for a deployment, the resources to allocate to each replica, and any custom code or settings that the user wants to include in the deployment.\n\nTo use user config in Ray Serve, a user can define a configuration file in YAML format that specifies the desired configuration options for their deployments. This file can then be used with the `serve deploy` command to deploy the application to a Ray cluster.\n\nFor example, a user might create a configuration file called `fruit_config.yaml` that contains the following configuration options for a deployment:\n```\ndeployments:\n  - name: FruitStand\n    num_replicas: 2\n    ray_actor_options:\n      runtime_env:\n        pip:\n          packages:\n            - requests\n      num_gpus: 1\n      memory: 1024\n    user_config:\n      fruit_list: [\"APPLE\", \"BANANA\", \"ORANGE\"]\n```\nThis configuration file specifies that the `FruitStand` deployment should have two replicas, each with one GPU and 1024 MB of memory. It also specifies a custom `user_config` dictionary that contains a list of fruits to be served by the deployment.\n\nOnce the configuration file is created, the user can deploy the application to a Ray cluster using the `serve deploy` command, passing in the configuration file as an argument:\n```\n$ serve deploy fruit_config.yaml\n```\nThis will deploy the `FruitStand` deployment to the Ray cluster, with the specified configuration options. The user can then use the `serve config` command to view the current configuration of the deployment, or the `serve update` command to update the configuration of the deployment.",

The `zero_copy_batch` parameter is set to `True`, which means that the batches will be provided as zero-copy, read-only views on the data in the object store. This can improve performance and decrease memory utilization.\n\nNote that if the function mutates its input, you should set `zero_copy_batch` to `False` to avoid \"assignment destination is read-only\" or \"buffer source array is read-only\" errors.",

Easy access: The actor can be easily accessed later somewhere in the code by using the `ray.get_actor()` method and passing the name of the actor as an argument.\n3. Garbage collection: The actor will still be garbage-collected if no handles to it exist, even if it has a name.\n4. Job-scope-unique name: In C++, named actors are job-scope-unique, meaning that the actor name is only valid within the job and cannot be accessed from another job.\n5. Get-or-create: The `get_if_exists` option for actor creation allows you to create an actor only if it doesn't exist, and if it does, a handle to the actor will be returned and the arguments will be ignored.",

This will cause the trial to be retried up to the specified number of times if it fails.\n\nHere is an example:\n```\nfrom ray import train, tune\n\n# Define the trainable function\ndef my_trainable(config):\n    # Do some training...\n    train.report({\"mean_accuracy\": 0.9})\n\n# Define the trial space\ntrial_space = {\"should_fail\": tune.choice([True, False])}\n\n# Define the failure configuration\nfailure_config = tune.FailureConfig(max_failures=2)\n\n# Start a Tune run and print the best result\ntuner = tune.Tuner(my_trainable, param_space=trial_space, failure_config=failure_config)\nresults = tuner.fit()\n```\nIn this example, the `my_trainable` function is defined to fail with a probability of 0.5 (i.e., `should_fail` is set to `True` with probability 0.5). The `FailureConfig` is set to retry the trial up to 2 times if it fails.\n\nWhen you run this code, you will see that the trial is retried up to 2 times if it fails, and the best result is printed at the end of the run.",

The GCS also uses Redis to implement a distributed locking mechanism, which allows the cluster to ensure that only one node can modify the GCS at a time.\n\nIn addition to the GCS, the Ray cluster also uses a separate Redis instance to store the state of the Ray actors. The actor state is stored in a Redis database that is separate from the GCS, and is used to store the state of the actors and their dependencies. The actor state is used to ensure that the actors can be restarted if they fail, and to ensure that the actors can be recreated if they are lost due to a failure.",

Install Ray Train and Torch packages: `pip install -U \"ray[train]\" tensorflow`\n2. Import Ray Train and Torch: `import ray.train as train`\n3. Define the training function: `def train_func_distributed()`\n4. Prepare the model and data for distributed training: `model = NeuralNetwork()` and `dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size)`\n5. Use the `ray.train.torch.prepare_model` and `ray.train.torch.prepare_data_loader` utility functions to set up the model and data for distributed training.\n6. Create a `TorchTrainer` object with the `train_func_distributed` function and a `ScalingConfig` object with the number of workers and GPU usage.\n7. Call the `fit` method on the `TorchTrainer` object to start the distributed training job.\n\nHere is an example code snippet:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray import train\nfrom ray.train import Checkpoint, ScalingConfig\nfrom ray.train.torch import TorchTrainer\n\n# Define the training function\ndef train_func_distributed():\n    num_epochs = 3\n    batch_size = 64\n\n    dataset = get_dataset()\n    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size)\n    dataloader = train.torch.prepare_data_loader(dataloader)\n\n    model = NeuralNetwork()\n    model = train.torch.prepare_model(model)\n\n    # Define the loss function and optimizer\n    loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()\n    optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)\n\n    # Train the model\n    for epoch in range(num_epochs):\n        for batch in dataloader:\n            inputs, targets = batch\n            optimizer.zero_grad()\n            outputs = model(inputs)\n            loss = loss_fn(outputs, targets)\n            loss.backward()\n            optimizer.step()\n\n# Create a TorchTrainer object\ntrainer = TorchTrainer(train_func_distributed, ScalingConfig(num_workers=4, use_gpu=True))\n\n# Start the distributed training job\nresults = trainer.fit()\n```\nNote that this is just an example code snippet, and you will need to modify it to fit your specific use case. Additionally, you will need to have Ray Train and Torch installed on your Databricks cluster in order to use this code.",

Pass the argument reference to tasks. This way, you make sure all tasks use the same copy of the argument, which is faster and uses less object store memory.\n3. Use `ray.get` to fetch the result of a remote object from an object ref. If the current node\u2019s object store does not contain the object, the object is downloaded.\n4. If the object is a numpy array or a collection of numpy arrays, the `get` call is zero-copy and returns arrays backed by shared object store memory. Otherwise, we deserialize the object data into a Python object.\n\nHere is an example code snippet:\n```python\nimport ray\n\n# Store the argument to the object store once and get an ObjectRef\nobj_ref = ray.put(1)\n\n# Pass the argument reference to tasks\n@ray.remote\ndef task1(obj_ref):\n    return ray.get(obj_ref)\n\n# Get the result of a remote object from an object ref\nresult = ray.get(task1.remote(obj_ref))\n\n# If the current node\u2019s object store does not contain the object, the object is downloaded\nassert result == 1\n```\nNote that `ray.get` can also be used to wait for the result to be available without retrieving it, by using the `ray.wait` method.",

Load your data into a Ray Dataset using the `ray.data.read_parquet` or `ray.data.read_csv` function.\n2. Define a Python class to load the pre-trained model.\n3. Transform your dataset using the pre-trained model by calling `ds.map_batches()`.\n4. Get the final predictions by either iterating through the output or saving the results.\n\nNote that for tabular data, you can use Ray Data preprocessors, which implement common data preprocessing operations. You can use this with Ray Train Trainers by applying them on the dataset before passing the dataset into a Trainer.\n\nIf your preprocessed Dataset is small enough to fit in Ray object store memory (by default this is 30% of total cluster RAM), materialize the preprocessed dataset in Ray\u2019s built-in object store, by calling `materialize()` on the preprocessed dataset. This method tells Ray Data to compute the entire preprocessed and pin it in the Ray object store memory. As a result, when iterating over the dataset repeatedly, the preprocessing operations do not need to be re-run. However, if the preprocessed data is too large to fit into Ray object store memory, this approach will greatly decreases performance as data needs to be spilled to and read back from disk.",

When a class is defined, the `__call__()` method is called whenever an instance of the class is called as a function.\n\nIn the context of Ray data batch inference, the `__call__()` method is used to define a function that can be applied to batches of data. The function takes as input a batch of all records from a single group, and returns a batch of zero or more records, similar to `map_batches()`.\n\nThe `__call__()` method is used to define the logic for performing inference on a batch of data. It is typically used in conjunction with the `map_batches()` method, which applies a function to batches of data in parallel. The `__call__()` method is used to define the function that is applied to each batch of data.\n\nIn the example code provided, the `__call__()` method is defined as a method of the `TorchPredictor` class. The method takes a batch of data as input, performs inference on the data using a pre-trained PyTorch model, and returns the results of the inference as a batch of data. The `map_batches()` method is then used to apply the `__call__()` method to each batch of data in the dataset, allowing for parallel inference to be performed on the entire dataset.",

The Ray Jobs API allows you to submit locally developed applications to a remote Ray Cluster for execution.\n\nHere is an example of how to submit a job with Python using local files:\n```\n# script.py\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\ndef hello_world():\n    return \"hello world\"\n\n# Submit the job\nclient = JobSubmissionClient(\"http://127.0.0.1:8265\")\njob_id = client.submit_job(\n    # Entrypoint shell command to execute\n    entrypoint=\"python script.py\",\n    # Path to the local directory that contains the script.py file\n    runtime_env={\"working_dir\": \"./\"}\n)\nprint(job_id)\n```\nIn this example, the `script.py` file is the entrypoint for the job, and the `runtime_env` argument specifies the local directory that contains the `script.py` file. The `client.submit_job()` method submits the job to the Ray cluster and returns the job ID.\n\nYou can also use the Ray Jobs API CLI to submit a job with Python using local files. Here is an example of how to do this:\n```\n$ ray job submit --working-dir=\".\" -- python script.py\n```\nIn this example, the `--working-dir` argument specifies the local directory that contains the `script.py` file, and the `--` argument separates the arguments to `ray job submit` from the arguments to the entrypoint command.",

You can then use the `ray.serve` module to make predictions on new data.\n\nFor example, if you have a new dataset that you want to make predictions on, you can use the `serve.predict` method to make predictions on the data. Here's an example of how you can do this:\n```\n# Load the new data\nnew_data = ...\n\n# Make predictions on the new data\npredictions = serve.predict(new_data)\n```\nThis will return the predictions for the new data.\n\nNote that you can also use the `serve.predict` method to make predictions on a single example, rather than a dataset. For example:\n```\n# Make a prediction on a single example\nprediction = serve.predict(new_data[0])\n```\nThis will return the prediction for the first example in the dataset.",

You can then use the `ray.remote` decorator to define remote functions and actors, and use the `ray.get()` function to retrieve the results of remote function calls.\n\nHere is an example of how you might write a unit test for a Ray application:\n```\nimport unittest\nimport ray\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n\n    def test_my_function(self):\n        @ray.remote\n        def my_function():\n            return 1\n\n        result = ray.get(my_function.remote())\n        self.assertEqual(result, 1)\n```\nThis test will start a new Ray cluster with 4 CPUs and 0 GPUs, and then define a remote function called `my_function` that returns the value 1. The test will then call the `my_function` remote function and retrieve the result using the `ray.get()` function. Finally, the test will assert that the result is equal to 1.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.cluster_utils.Cluster` class to create a mini-cluster with a specific number of nodes and resources, and then use the `ray.init()` function to connect to the cluster. This can be useful for testing your application in a distributed environment.\n\nFor example:\n```\nimport unittest\nimport ray\nfrom ray.cluster_utils import Cluster\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        cluster = Cluster(num_nodes=2, num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n        ray.init(address=cluster.address)\n\n    def test_my_function(self):\n        @ray.remote\n        def my_function():\n            return 1\n\n        result = ray.get(my_function.remote())\n        self.assertEqual(result, 1)\n```\nThis test will create a mini-cluster with 2 nodes, each with 4 CPUs and 0 GPUs, and then connect to the cluster using the `ray.init()` function. The rest of the test is the same as the previous example.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.",

This will cause the actor to immediately exit its process, causing any current, pending, and future tasks to fail with a `RayActorError`. If you would like Ray to automatically restart the actor, make sure to set a nonzero `max_restarts` in the `@ray.remote` options for the actor, then pass the flag `no_restart=False` to `ray.kill`.",

If you need to shuffle data more efficiently, you can use the `local_shuffle_buffer_size` parameter to specify the size of the buffer used for local shuffling.

Reproduce the issue: Run the Python file that contains the `ray.get()` call, and call `ray debug` to start the debugger.\n2. Set a breakpoint: Press `0` to select the breakpoint, and then press `Enter` to set the breakpoint.\n3. Jump into the call: Use the `remote` command to jump into the call.\n4. Print the value of `n`: Use the `p(n)` command to print the value of `n`.\n5. Continue debugging: Use the `c` command to continue debugging.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `ray.get()` method to fetch the result of a remote object from an object ref. If the current node's object store does not contain the object, the object is downloaded.\n\nIt's important to note that calling `ray.get()` in a loop can harm performance, as it blocks the driver process until all results are available.

The `working_dir` parameter can be a local path or a remote URI, and it can be used to specify multiple working directories for different applications.\n\nFor example, you can use the following code to specify multiple working directories for different applications:\n```\napplications:\n  - name: Model1\n    import_path: my_module:my_model_code\n    args:\n      model_uri: s3://my_bucket/model_1\n    runtime_env:\n      working_dir: /path/to/working/dir1\n  - name: Model2\n    import_path: my_module:my_model_code\n    args:\n      model_uri: s3://my_bucket/model_2\n    runtime_env:\n      working_dir: /path/to/working/dir2\n  - name: Model3\n    import_path: my_module:my_model_code\n    args:\n      model_uri: s3://my_bucket/model_3\n    runtime_env:\n      working_dir: /path/to/working/dir3\n```\nIn this example, the `working_dir` parameter is used to specify a different working directory for each application. The working directories can be local paths or remote URIs, and they can be used to store data or code for each application.\n\nIt's important to note that the `working_dir` parameter is only used to specify the working directory for the application, and it does not affect the behavior of the `RAY_CHDIR_TO_TRIAL_DIR` environment variable. The `RAY_CHDIR_TO_TRIAL_DIR` environment variable is used to control whether Ray Tune changes the working directory of each worker to its corresponding trial directory, and it can be set to `0` to disable this behavior.",

It is a logical resource requirement, meaning that it does not limit the actual physical resource usage of the task or actor. The `num_cpus` argument is used to schedule tasks and actors on nodes with sufficient CPU resources. If a task or actor requires more CPU resources than available on a node, it will not be scheduled on that node.\n\nThe `num_cpus` argument can be set to a specific value, such as `num_cpus=2`, or it can be set to `num_cpus=0` to indicate that the task or actor does not require any CPU resources.\n\nIt is recommended to always explicitly set `num_cpus` for actors to avoid any surprises. If resources are specified explicitly, they are required for both scheduling and running.\n\nIn addition to `num_cpus`, Ray also supports specifying other resource requirements, such as `num_gpus` and `resources`, which can be used to specify the number of GPUs or other types of resources required for a task or actor.",

Install the KubeRay operator on your Kubernetes cluster using Helm.\n2. Create a RayCluster custom resource (CR) that describes the desired state of your Ray cluster.\n3. Apply the RayCluster CR to your Kubernetes cluster using kubectl.\n4. Monitor the progress of the cluster setup using ray monitor.\n5. Once the cluster is set up, you can submit jobs to the cluster using ray submit.\n\nThe KubeRay operator also supports autoscaling, which allows you to automatically scale your Ray cluster up or down based on resource demand. To configure autoscaling for your Ray cluster, you can use the RayService CR to define your Ray cluster and its Ray Serve applications, and then use kubectl to create the cluster and its applications.",

Find per Task and Actor Memory Usage: This section explains how to locate the Tasks and Actors that have high memory usage. It covers using the per Task and Actor memory usage graph and the CLI command htop.\n3. Out-Of-Memory Prevention: This section explains how to address out-of-memory issues in Ray. It covers enabling and configuring the memory monitor, using the memory monitor to detect and resolve memory issues, and using the Ray Dashboard to view out-of-memory killer-specific events and metrics.\n4. Memory Management: This page describes how memory management works in Ray.\n5. Handling CPU out-of-memory failures: This section explains how to handle CPU out-of-memory failures in Ray. It covers limiting the number of model replicas that can run concurrently on the same node and overriding CPU or memory resources.\n\nYou can also use the following tools to debug out of memory issues:\n\n1. memray: This tool can be used to debug memory leaks in Serve actors. It logs memory usage to bin files and generates flamegraphs of the memory usage.\n2. ray memory: This tool provides features to make the memory debugging experience more effective. It allows you to add arguments such as sort-by=OBJECT_SIZE and group-by=STACK_TRACE to track down the line of code where a memory leak occurs.",

For example:\n```\ntrainer = Trainer(\n    ...,\n    callbacks=[MyCallback()],\n)\n```\nYou can also use the `RayTrainReportCallback` class to report metrics and checkpoints to Ray Train.

The cluster will immediately attempt to scale to accommodate the requested resources, bypassing normal upscaling speed constraints.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.up` command to launch a Ray cluster and specify the number of workers and the resources required for each worker. For example:\n```\nray up ray/python/ray/autoscaler/aws/example-full.yaml --min-workers 10 --max-workers 20 --no-restart\n```\nThis will launch a Ray cluster with 10 workers and a maximum of 20 workers, and will not restart Ray services during the update.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.autoscaler.sdk.request_resources()` function to request resources for a specific placement group. For example:\n```\nray.autoscaler.sdk.request_resources(num_cpus=10, bundles=[{\"CPU\": 2, \"GPU\": 1}], placement_group=\"my_placement_group\")\n```\nThis will request 10 CPUs and 1 GPU for the placement group \"my_placement_group\".

            "answer": "  The GCS (Global Control Service) server is a centralized metadata server for a Ray cluster. It runs on the head node and has functions like managing node membership and actor directory. The GCS server is responsible for storing and managing the metadata of the Ray cluster, such as the list of nodes, the list of actors, and the status of the tasks.\n\nThe GCS server is taking up a lot of memory on the head node because it needs to store all the metadata of the Ray cluster in memory. This is necessary for the GCS server to function properly and to provide fast access to the metadata.\n\nTo reduce the memory usage of the GCS server, you can try the following:\n\n1. Use a larger head node with more memory.\n2. Use a distributed database like HA Redis to store the metadata instead of storing it all in memory.\n3. Use a smaller Ray cluster with fewer nodes and actors.\n4. Use the --num-cpus=0 option to specify the number of CPUs to use for the GCS server. This can help reduce the memory usage of the GCS server.\n5. Use the --redis-shard-ports option to specify the ports for non-primary Redis shards. This can help reduce the memory usage of the GCS server.\n6. Use the --dashboard-grpc-port option to specify the gRPC port used by the dashboard. This can help reduce the memory usage of the GCS server.\n7. Use the --include-dashboard option to specify whether to include the dashboard in the GCS server. This can help reduce the memory usage of the GCS server.\n8. Use the --dashboard-port option to specify the port for the dashboard. This can help reduce the memory usage of the GCS server.\n\nIt is important to note that reducing the memory usage of the GCS server may affect the performance of the Ray cluster. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the trade-offs between memory usage and performance when configuring the GCS server.",

This will shuffle a subset of rows up to the provided buffer size during iteration, rather than shuffling all rows.\n\nHere's an example:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Read the dataset\nds = ray.data.read_text(\"s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/sms_spam_collection_subset.txt\")\n\n# Enable local shuffling with a buffer size of 1000 rows\nds = ds.iter_batches(local_shuffle_buffer_size=1000)\n\n# Map the batches\nds = ds.map_batches(lambda batch: batch.map(lambda row: row[\"text\"]))\n```\nIn this example, the `local_shuffle_buffer_size` parameter is set to 1000, which means that Ray Data will shuffle a subset of 1000 rows during each iteration. This can help improve performance by reducing the amount of data movement required during shuffling.\n\nNote that local shuffling is not a true global shuffle, and it may not be suitable for all use cases. If you need a true global shuffle, you can use the `random_shuffle()` method instead.",

The Kuberay operator logs contain information about the Serve application deployment event and Serve application health checks.\n\nAlternatively, you can check the controller log and deployment log, which are located under `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/` in both the head node pod and worker node pod. These logs contain information about specific deployment failure reasons and autoscaling events.\n\nYou can also use the Ray dashboard to get a high-level overview of your Ray cluster and Ray Serve application\u2019s states. The Ray dashboard provides details such as the number of deployment replicas currently running, logs for your Serve controller, deployment replicas, and proxies, and the Ray nodes (i.e. machines) running in your Ray cluster.\n\nTo understand system-level behavior and to surface application-level details during runtime, you can leverage Ray logging. Ray Serve uses Python\u2019s standard logging module with a logger named \"ray.serve\". By default, logs are emitted from actors both to stderr and on disk on each node at `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/`. This includes both system-level logs from the Serve controller and proxy as well as access logs and custom user logs produced from within deployment replicas.\n\nIn development, logs are streamed to the driver Ray program (the Python script that calls `serve.run()` or the serve run CLI command), so it\u2019s convenient to keep the driver running while debugging.",

This method returns a list of up to `limit` rows from the dataset.\n\nFor example, to take the first 10 rows of a dataset, you can use the following code:\n```\nimport ray\n\nds = ray.data.range(100)\nrows = ds.take(10)\nprint(rows)\n```\nThis will print a list of 10 dictionaries, each representing a row in the dataset.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `take_all()` method to take all rows in the dataset. This method returns a list of all rows in the dataset, and is useful when you want to iterate over the entire dataset.\n```\nimport ray\n\nds = ray.data.range(100)\nrows = ds.take_all()\nprint(rows)\n```\nThis will print a list of 100 dictionaries, each representing a row in the dataset.\n\nNote that the `take()` and `take_all()` methods trigger execution of the lazy transformations performed on the dataset. This means that the data will be processed and transformed as needed before being returned.",

            "answer": "  \nIt seems like you are looking for information on how to load all checkpoints from trials of a Tune experiment launched with `tune.run`. You can do this by using the `Tuner.restore()` method and setting the `resume_errored` parameter to `True`. This will allow you to resume the experiment from the last saved checkpoint.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use this method:\n```\nfrom ray import tune\n\n# Restore the experiment\ntuner = tune.Tuner.restore(\n    \"s3://my-checkpoints-bucket/path/my-tune-exp\",\n    trainable=my_trainable,\n    resume_errored=True\n)\n\n# Fit the tuner\nresults = tuner.fit()\n```\nThis will restore the experiment from the last saved checkpoint and continue training from there.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `Tuner.load_checkpoint()` method to load a specific checkpoint. This method takes the path to the checkpoint file as an argument and returns a `Checkpoint` object that you can use to resume training.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use this method:\n```\nfrom ray import tune\n\n# Load the checkpoint\ncheckpoint = tuner.load_checkpoint(\"s3://my-checkpoints-bucket/path/my-tune-exp/checkpoint_1\")\n\n# Fit the tuner\nresults = tuner.fit(checkpoint=checkpoint)\n```\nThis will load the checkpoint from the specified path and use it to resume training.\n\nI hope this helps!

Identify the IP address of the head node in your KubeRay cluster. You can do this by running the command `kubectl get nodes` and looking for the head node's IP address.\n2. Set the `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` variable to the IP address of the head node, followed by the port number that Grafana is running on (e.g., `http://<head_node_ip>:3000`).\n3. Set the `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST` variable to the IP address of the head node, followed by the port number that Prometheus is running on (e.g., `http://<head_node_ip>:9090`).\n\nFor example, if the IP address of the head node is `192.168.1.100`, you can set the variables as follows:\n```\nRAY_GRAFANA_HOST=http://192.168.1.100:3000\nRAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST=http://192.168.1.100:9090\n```\nNote that the port numbers used in the examples are just examples and may need to be adjusted based on your specific configuration.",

For example, if you have 1 GPU available, you can use the following command:\n```\nray start --num-gpus=1\n```\nThis will make the GPU available to Ray and allow you to use it for training models.\n\nNote that you can also use the `--num-cpus` flag to specify the number of CPUs available on your machine. For example, if you have 4 CPUs available, you can use the following command:\n```\nray start --num-cpus=4\n```\nThis will make all 4 CPUs available to Ray and allow you to use them for training models.\n\nIt's important to note that Ray will only schedule tasks on nodes that have the resources you request. So if you request 2 GPUs for a task, but your cluster only has 1 GPU available, the task will not be scheduled.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.autoscaler.sdk.request_resources` function to request custom resources from the autoscaler. For example, to request 2 GPUs, you can use the following code:\n```\nimport ray\n\nray.init()\nray.autoscaler.sdk.request_resources(bundles=[{\"GPU\": 2}])\n```\nThis will request 2 GPUs from the autoscaler and make them available to Ray.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.autoscaler.sdk.request_resources` function to request custom resources from the autoscaler.

The Python SDK provides a `JobSubmissionClient` class that allows you to submit jobs programmatically and retrieve information about the job, including the dashboard link.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `JobSubmissionClient` class to get the dashboard link for a job:\n```\nfrom ray.job_submission import JobSubmissionClient\n\n# Initialize the client\nclient = JobSubmissionClient(address=\"http://localhost:8265\")\n\n# Submit a job\njob_id = client.submit_job(\n    entrypoint=\"python script.py\",\n    runtime_env={\"working_dir\": \".\"},\n    metadata={\"name\": \"my_job\"}\n)\n\n# Get the dashboard link for the job\ndashboard_link = client.get_dashboard_link(job_id)\n\nprint(dashboard_link)\n```\nThis code will submit a job with the entrypoint `python script.py` and the working directory set to the current directory. It will then retrieve the dashboard link for the job and print it to the console.\n\nNote that the `JobSubmissionClient` class also provides other methods for retrieving information about the job, such as `get_job_info` and `get_job_logs`. You can use these methods to get additional information about the job, such as its status and output.",

Adjust the threshold for disk utilization by setting the `local_fs_capacity_threshold` parameter in the `ray.init()` method.\n3. Use a faster storage device, such as an NVMe SSD, to reduce the time it takes to write objects to disk.\n4. Use a remote storage service, such as Amazon S3, to store objects instead of the local file system.\n5. Monitor the spill stats using the `ray memory` command to ensure that objects are being spilled at a reasonable rate and that the disk utilization is within a safe threshold.",
