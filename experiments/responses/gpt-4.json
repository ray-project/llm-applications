Configure the batch format: Ray Data represents batches as dicts of NumPy ndarrays or pandas DataFrames by default. You can specify the batch format in `map_batches()`.\n\n2. Be mindful of the batch size: Large block size can lead to potential out-of-memory situations. Make sure no single item in your Ray Data is too large, and always call `ds.map_batches()` with a batch size small enough so that the output batch can fit into memory comfortably.\n\n3. Use tasks to transform batches: To transform batches with tasks, call `map_batches()`. Ray Data uses tasks by default.\n\n4. Handle Torch tensors: Transformations applied with `map` or `map_batches` can return Torch tensors. However, Ray Data automatically converts Torch tensors to NumPy arrays. Subsequent transformations accept NumPy arrays as input, not Torch tensors.\n\n5. Deal with variable-shape tensors: If your tensors vary in shape, Ray Data represents batches as arrays of object dtype. The individual elements of these object arrays are regular ndarrays.\n\nRemember to import the necessary libraries and modules such as `numpy`, `ray`, `pandas`, and `torch` as needed."

            "answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by automatically adjusting the deployment's number of replicas based on its load. The Ray Serve Autoscaler, an application-level autoscaler, requests Ray to start a specific number of replica actors based on the request demand. If the Ray Autoscaler determines there aren't enough available CPUs for these actors, it requests more Ray nodes. The underlying cloud provider then adds more nodes. The autoscaler only reacts to task and actor resource requests, not application metrics or physical resource utilization. Ray Serve Autoscaling also allows the min_replicas to be 0 when starting your deployment; the scale-up begins when you start sending traffic."

It is often used in conjunction with PySpark for large scale data processing. However, it may not be as well-suited for GPU workloads for deep learning inference as Ray.\n\nRay, on the other hand, is designed for both batch processing and streaming workloads. It is particularly well-suited for GPU workloads for deep learning inference. Ray also allows for the use of Dask and Spark libraries in the same application without needing two different clusters, which can be beneficial for certain use cases.\n\nDask is a Python parallel computing library that is geared towards scaling analytics and scientific computing workloads. It mimics the APIs of familiar tools like NumPy and Pandas, allowing for larger-than-memory data operations to be run on a multi-machine cluster. However, Dask-on-Ray is an ongoing project and may not achieve the same performance as using Ray directly.\n\nIn summary, the choice between Spark, Ray, and Dask depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand, including the nature of the workload, the need for GPU support, and the desired programming interface."

For example, a task that requires one logical CPU can launch multiple threads and use multiple physical CPUs. Ray does not prevent this from happening. It's the user's responsibility to ensure that tasks or actors use no more resources than specified via resource requirements. If tasks or actors use more than their proportionate share of memory, it may overload a node and cause issues like Out Of Memory (OOM).

            "answer": "Ray Serve offers several advantages over other tools like Modal or Seldon. Firstly, it is framework-agnostic, meaning it can work with any model packaging and registry format. This provides a lot of flexibility in terms of the models you can use. Secondly, Ray Serve focuses on model composition, allowing for multi-model composition using a programmable API. This makes calls to different models as simple as function calls, even if the models use different resources and run across different machines in the cluster. \n\nIn addition, Ray Serve provides key features for building production-ready machine learning applications, including best-in-class autoscaling and natural integration with business logic. It also allows for flexible scaling up and resource allocation. \n\nAs for why you can't just do it via containers, while containers can be used for deploying models, they may not provide the same level of flexibility, scalability, and ease of use as a dedicated serving layer like Ray Serve. \n\nFinally, because Ray Serve is built on top of Ray, it can run anywhere Ray can, including on your laptop, Kubernetes, any major cloud provider, or even on-premise. This makes it a highly versatile tool for serving machine learning models."

            "answer": "To deploy an LLM workload on top of Ray Serve, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Write your LLM application steps as a single Python module. This is possible because Ray Serve supports any arbitrary Python code.\n\n2. Configure your deployments to scale out by increasing the number of deployment replicas and assign replica resources such as CPUs and GPUs.\n\n3. Deploy your Serve application to production on a Ray cluster using the Ray Serve CLI. The command 'serve deploy' takes in a config file path and deploys that file to a Ray cluster over HTTP. This could be a local, single-node cluster or a remote, multi-node cluster started with the Ray Cluster Launcher.\n\n4. For heavyweight code updates like runtime_env changes, start a new Ray Cluster, update your Serve config file, and deploy the file with 'serve deploy' to the new cluster. Once the new deployment is finished, switch your traffic to the new cluster.\n\n5. At runtime, a deployment consists of a number of replicas, which are individual copies of the class or function that are started in separate Ray Actors (processes). The number of replicas can be scaled up or down (or even autoscaled) to match the incoming request load.\n\nRemember to check for the variable in your environment to make sure you\u2019re using your desired Ray agent address.

Check the output of the Ray job using the command `kubectl logs -l=job-name=rayjob-sample`.\n\n2. If the Ray Job is submitted by the Job API, the Job logs are available from the Dashboard. The log file follows the format: job-driver-<job_submission_id>.log. If you executed the Driver directly on the Head Node of the Ray Cluster or ran with Ray Client, the Driver logs are not accessible from the Dashboard. In this case, see the terminal or Jupyter Notebook output to view the Driver logs.\n\n3. Use the `ray logs` command to get logs based on filename or resource identifiers. For example, to print the last 500 lines of raylet.out on a head node, use `ray logs raylet.out --tail 500`. You can also follow the log file with an actor id using `ray logs actor --id ABC --follow`.\n\n4. Use the `ray job logs` command to get the logs of a job. For example, `ray job logs [OPTIONS] JOB_ID`. You can also follow the logs using the `--follow` option.\n\nRemember, Ray does not provide a native storage solution for log data.

This is likely because the tasks or actors are using more memory than is available on the node. \n\nTo debug this issue, you can:\n\n1. Check the memory usage of your tasks or actors. You can use tools like `top` or `htop` on the node to monitor memory usage. \n\n2. Try reducing the number of workers or the size of the data each worker is handling at a time. \n\n3. If possible, try to optimize your code to use less memory. This could involve things like using more memory-efficient data structures or algorithms, or freeing up memory that's no longer needed.\n\n4. You can also check the logs for more detailed information about the workers killed on the node using the command provided in the error message: `ray logs raylet.out -ip <node-ip>`. This might give you more insight into what's causing the high memory usage.\n\n5. If your tasks or actors are using TensorFlow, you might want to check if TensorFlow is pre-allocating a large amount of memory. By default, TensorFlow maps nearly all of the GPU memory to its process which might cause OOM. You can manage this by allowing TensorFlow to grow the memory usage as is needed by the process or limit the amount of GPU memory that TensorFlow can use.\n\nRemember, debugging is a process of elimination and it might take several attempts to find the root cause of the problem."

This allows you to easily make changes to the Ray source code.\n\n2. Define a runtime environment to ensure that the Ray workers have access to all necessary packages. If these dependencies are already included in your Docker image or installed on each node, you can ignore the runtime_env argument.\n\n3. Install the full version of Ray using pip install \"ray[default]\". This feature is available starting with Ray 1.4.0 and is currently supported on macOS and Linux, with beta support on Windows.\n\n4. Use Ray's runtime environments to avoid dependency conflicts. This allows an application to override the default environment on the Ray Cluster and run in an isolated environment, similar to virtual environments in single-node Python.\n\n5. Prepare your dependencies on the cluster in advance using the Ray Cluster Launcher, or use Ray\u2019s runtime environments to install them on the fly.\n\n6. Prepare a single environment across the cluster before starting the Ray runtime using the Ray Cluster launcher. You can build all your files and dependencies into a container image and specify this in your Cluster YAML Configuration. You can also install packages using setup_commands in the Ray Cluster configuration file; these commands will be run as each node joins the cluster."

Here are some general steps you can follow:\n\n1. **Check the logs**: Ray should provide logs for each worker. Check these logs for any error messages or exceptions that might indicate what's causing the deadlock.\n\n2. **Use a debugger**: You can use a Python debugger like pdb to step through your code and find where it's getting stuck. \n\n3. **Check your resource usage**: Deadlocks can sometimes be caused by resource contention. Make sure you're not running out of CPU, memory, or other resources.\n\n4. **Inspect your tasks and actors**: You can use Ray's built-in tools to inspect the state of your tasks and actors. This can help you see if there's a particular task or actor that's causing the deadlock.\n\n5. **Check your code for synchronization issues**: Deadlocks often occur when tasks or actors are waiting for each other in a way that causes them to all get stuck. Check your code to make sure you're not creating any circular dependencies between tasks or actors.\n\n6. **Try simplifying your code**: If you're still having trouble finding the cause of the deadlock, try simplifying your code or creating a minimal reproducible example. This can often make it easier to find the problem.\n\nRemember that Ray's Rollout Workers are used as @ray.remote actors to collect and return samples from environments or offline files in parallel. If you have only initialized a single worker, your entire code is submitted and ran on a single worker the whole time, which might be causing the deadlock."

For example:\n\n```python\ndef add_dog_years(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    batch[\"age_in_dog_years\"] = 7 * batch[\"age\"]\n    return batch\n```\n\nIn this case, you can set `zero_copy_batch=True` to utilize the 'zero-copy' feature.\n\nAlso, Ray optimizes for numpy arrays by using Pickle protocol 5 with out-of-band data. The numpy array is stored as a read-only object, and all Ray workers on the same node can read the numpy array in the object store without copying (zero-copy reads). Each numpy array object in the worker process holds a pointer to the relevant array held in shared memory. Any writes to the read-only object will require the user to first copy it into the local process memory.\n\nIf you need to mutate the array, you can manually copy the array at the destination (arr = arr.copy()). This is effectively like disabling the zero-copy deserialization feature provided by Ray."

This method requires the trial as a parameter and optionally, a metric and mode. If no trial is specified, it uses the metric and mode to identify the best trial and load the last checkpoint from it. The method returns the path for the last checkpoint of the trial. \n\nHere is an example of how to use it:\n\n```python\nfrom ray.tune import ExperimentAnalysis\n\nanalysis = ExperimentAnalysis(...)\nbest_checkpoint = analysis.get_best_checkpoint(trial, metric, mode)\n```\n\nIf you didn't pass metric and mode parameters to `tune.run()`, you can use `get_best_checkpoint(trial, metric, mode)` instead. \n\nYou can also use `get_last_checkpoint(trial, metric, mode)` to get the last persistent checkpoint path of the provided trial, i.e., with the highest \"training_iteration\". \n\nAnother method, `get_trial_checkpoints_paths(trial, metric)`, gets paths and metrics of all persistent checkpoints of a trial."

State Management: An actor's instance variables can hold the global state and pass the actor handle to places where the state needs to be modified or accessed. This makes state management easier.\n2. Efficiency: The actor-based approach is more efficient because it reuses model initialization for many tasks, allowing the node to spend more time on the actual workload.\n3. Flexibility: Tasks are scheduled more flexibly when using actors.\n\nDisadvantages of using singleton Actor:\n1. Limited Support: Using class variables to manage state between instances of the same class is not supported. Each actor instance is instantiated in its own process, so each actor will have its own copy of the class variables.\n2. Overhead: If you don\u2019t need the stateful part of an actor, you\u2019re mostly better off using tasks. This implies that using actors might introduce unnecessary overhead in some cases."

Named actors can be used to reuse model initialization for many tasks, making the actor-based approach more efficient. The node will spend more time on the actual workload.\n\n3. Named actors can be retrieved as long as the original driver is still running, even if they are not detached.\n\n4.

This will help in reducing the size of the actor.\n\n3. If you are using GPUs for inference, ensure that you move the model and data to and from the GPU correctly. Also, specify `num_gpus=1` in the `ds.map_batches()` call to indicate that each actor should use 1 GPU.\n\n4. If you are transforming batches with actors, ensure that you implement a class, perform setup in `__init__` and transform data in `__call__`. Also, create an `ActorPoolStrategy` and configure the number of concurrent workers. Each worker should transform a partition of data.\n\n5. Check your batch size. If you have access to large GPUs, you may want to increase the batch size to better saturate them. However, to ensure full parallelization across an actor pool, the specified batch size should be at most equal to the size of the actor pool.\n\n6. If you are using an `ActorPool`, ensure that you are not submitting large files or data to the actors.

Ray clusters can also be created for interactive use, such as Databricks Notebooks. Ray Train, Data, and Serve provide integration with Feature Stores like Feast for Training and Serving. Ray Train and Tune provide integration with tracking services such as MLFlow and Weights & Biases.\n\n6. Finally, you can use Ray Serve to deploy your trained model.\n\nRemember to replace the code snippets with your own dataset, model, and training function."

This ID can then be used to pass the object as an argument to any remote function or method call. This is a synchronous operation.\n\nExample: `object_id = ray.put(my_object)`\n\nTo use `ray.get()`, you call the function with the object ID or a list of object IDs as an argument. This function will return the object or list of objects from the object store corresponding to the provided ID(s). This is also a synchronous operation, meaning it will block further execution until the operation is complete.\n\nExample: `my_object = ray.get(object_id)`\n\nIt's generally best practice to delay calling `ray.get()` as long as possible, or even design your program to avoid having to call `ray.get()` at all."

This can be done using the `ray.init()` function.\n\n```python\nimport ray\nray.init()\n```\n\n2. Define a remote function: You can define a remote function using the `@ray.remote` decorator. This function will be used to process your files. For example:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote\ndef process(file):\n    # Actual work is reading the file and process the data.\n    # Assume it needs to use 2G memory.\n    pass\n```\n\n3. Use Ray Data operations: Ray Data supports a wide range of preprocessing operations that can be used to transform your data prior to training. These include simple transformations such as maps (`map_batches()`), global and grouped aggregations (`groupby()`), and shuffling operations (`random_shuffle()`, `sort()`, `repartition()`).\n\nRemember, Ray Data is particularly suited for offline batch inference and data preprocessing and ingest for ML training. It serves as a last-mile bridge from storage or ETL pipeline outputs to distributed applications and libraries in Ray. It's not intended to replace more general data processing systems. For more details on how to use Ray Data for preprocessing and ingest for ML training, refer to the guide on 'Data loading for ML training'."

Create a test class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.\n\n```python\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n```\n\n3.

If you want to share the Ray cluster across tests for speedup, you can initialize Ray in the `setUpClass` method instead of `setUp`.\n\n```python\n@classmethod\ndef setUpClass(cls):\n    ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n```\n\n6. Run your tests. In Python, you can do this with the `unittest` module's command-line interface.\n\nRemember to be careful when running tests in parallel due to the nature of parallel programs."

This allows for parallelism as multiple operations can be launched in parallel. To get the actual results, you need to call ray.get() on the IDs of the results. This call blocks until the results are available. In async actors, only one task can be running at any point in time. Ray runs all of the methods inside a single Python event loop. Blocking ray.get or ray.wait inside an async actor method is not allowed as it will block the execution of the event loop."

            "answer": "To debug a hanging `ray.get()` call, you can use Ray's debugger. After running your program, execute `ray debug`. You can then select the breakpoint by pressing 0 and enter. This will allow you to jump into the call with the remote command in Ray\u2019s debugger. Inside the function, you can print the value of variables to understand the state of your program.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that `ray.get()` is a blocking operation, which means it waits until the requested result is available. If it's called in a loop, the loop will not continue until the `ray.get()` call is resolved. Therefore, it's recommended to avoid calling `ray.get()` in a loop or for intermediate steps. Instead, work with object references directly and only call `ray.get()` at the end to get the final result. \n\nIf your program is still hanging, consider separating the call to `ray.get()` from the call to the remote functions. This allows all remote functions to be spawned before waiting for the results, enabling them to run in parallel in the background. You can also pass a list of object references to `ray.get()` instead of calling it one by one, to wait for all tasks to finish."

Therefore, if you set num_cpus=0, it will prevent tasks with non-zero CPU requirements from being scheduled on the node. This is often done for the head node to avoid scheduling additional tasks on it due to heavy networking load."

            "answer": "To manually configure and manage a Ray cluster on Kubernetes, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Understand the operator pattern of Ray deployments on Kubernetes. The key components are a custom resource called a RayCluster that describes the desired state of a Ray cluster, and a custom controller, the KubeRay operator, which manages Ray pods to match the RayCluster\u2019s spec.\n\n2. To deploy a Ray cluster, create a RayCluster custom resource (CR) by applying a configuration file (raycluster.yaml) using the command: `kubectl apply -f raycluster.yaml`.\n\n3. Configure and manage the Ray Dashboard, which is a crucial tool for monitoring and debugging Ray applications and clusters. The configurations may vary depending on how you launch Ray Clusters (e.g., local Ray Cluster v.s. KubeRay). Integrations with Prometheus and Grafana are optional for an enhanced Dashboard experience.\n\n4. Use the RayService for Kubernetes-native support for Ray clusters and Ray Serve applications. After defining a Ray cluster and its Ray Serve applications using a Kubernetes config, you can use `kubectl` to create the cluster and its applications. You can also update the Ray Serve config in the RayService CR config and use `kubectl apply` to update the applications.\n\n5. Use the RayJob for Kubernetes-native support for Ray clusters and Ray jobs. You can define a Ray cluster and job using a Kubernetes config, and use `kubectl` to create them. The cluster can be deleted automatically once the job is finished.\n\n6. Deploy the Ray cluster. The Ray cluster is configured such that one Ray pod will be scheduled per 16-CPU Kubernetes node. This pattern of one Ray pod per Kubernetes node is encouraged, but not required. It is generally more efficient to use a few large Ray pods than many small ones. Review the config file applied in the command before deploying the cluster."

If the port 52365 (or whichever port you specify with --dashboard-agent-listen-port) is unavailable when Ray starts, the dashboard agent\u2019s HTTP server will fail, but the dashboard agent and Ray will continue to run. \n\nFor more in-depth debugging, you could check the dashboard log at <RAY_LOG_DIR>/dashboard.log, which is usually /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/dashboard.log. \n\nRemember, for security purposes, do not expose Ray Dashboard publicly without proper authentication in place."

It is a crucial component of the Ray cluster and runs on the head node. The GCS server is memory-intensive because all the data is stored in-memory. Its failure can cause the entire Ray cluster to fail, hence it requires a significant amount of memory. \n\nThe head node, where the GCS server runs, has more memory-demanding system components such as the GCS or the dashboard. Also, the driver runs from a head node by default. If the head node has the same memory capacity as worker nodes and if you execute the same number of Tasks and Actors from a head node, it can easily have out-of-memory problems. \n\nTo avoid this, you can avoid running any Tasks and Actors on the head node by specifying --num-cpus=0 when starting a head node by ray start --head. Also, tuning the operating system settings can help as all nodes and workers connect to the GCS, creating many network connections that the operating system has to support. \n\nIn addition, when deploying a large cluster, Ray\u2019s architecture means that the head node has extra stress due to additional system processes running on it like GCS. Therefore, a good starting hardware specification for the head node is 8 CPUs and 32 GB memory. The actual hardware specification depends on the workload and the size of the cluster."

Start a Ray cluster on AWS: Ray Data can be used on any cloud provider including AWS. You can start a Ray cluster on AWS using the Ray cluster launcher.\n\n3. Load your data into a Ray Dataset: Ray Data supports many different datasources and formats. You can create datasets from on-disk files, Python objects, and cloud storage services like S3. For example, to load a CSV file from S3, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\nimport ray\nds = ray.data.read_csv(\"s3://anonymous@air-example-data/iris.csv\")\nds.show(limit=1)\n```\n\n4. Define a Python class to load the pre-trained model: This step is necessary if you are using Ray Data for offline inference.\n\n5. Transform your dataset using the pre-trained model by calling `ds.map_batches()`. \n\nRemember that Ray Data requires schemas for all datasets in Ray 2.5. Standalone Python objects are no longer supported and the default batch format is fixed to NumPy. If you want to revert to legacy behavior temporarily, set the environment variable `RAY_DATA_STRICT_MODE=0` on all cluster processes."

These are the addresses that the head node uses to access Grafana and Prometheus.\n\nIf your head node IP is changing every time you reconfigure your cluster, you might want to consider using a service discovery mechanism or DNS that can dynamically update the IP addresses. This way, you can set the `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` and `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST` to the DNS names instead of the IP addresses, and the DNS will resolve to the current IP of the head node.\n\nFor KubeRay users, you can use Kubernetes' built-in service discovery mechanism. When you create a service in Kubernetes, it automatically gets a DNS name that resolves to the current IP of the service. You can use this DNS name to set your `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` and `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST` variables."

            "answer": "The reasons for spikes in node CPU utilization could be due to several factors such as:\n\n1. High outbound bandwidth usage: The head node might be heavily stressed due to high outbound bandwidth usage. \n\n2. High memory usage: If the node is running low on memory, it might lead to high CPU utilization. For instance, if the memory usage exceeds the threshold of 0.95, Ray might kill the worker causing a spike in CPU usage.\n\n3. Large number of tasks: If there are a large number of tasks running concurrently, it might lead to high CPU usage. For example, if you request resources for 100 tasks and there are already 45 tasks running, the system will try to add enough nodes so that up to 100 tasks can run concurrently, potentially causing a spike in CPU usage.\n\n4. Pinning Object IDs: The operation of pinning object IDs in the NodeManagerService could also contribute to CPU usage.\n\n5. Training iterations: If there are training iterations running, they could also contribute to CPU usage."

Here are a few troubleshooting steps you can take:\n\n1. Check the connection: Ensure that the worker node can connect to the head node. If there's an issue with the connection, you might see an error like \"Unable to connect to GCS at ...\". You can use tools like nmap or nc to check if each port can be reached from a node.\n\n2. Check the IP address: The worker node might not be able to access the IP address given. You can use the command `ip route get xx.xx.xx.xx` on the worker node to start debugging routing issues.\n\n3. Check the GCS: The Global Control Service (GCS) manages cluster-level metadata. If there's an issue with the GCS, it could cause the health check to fail. By default, the GCS is not fault tolerant since all the data is stored in-memory and its failure means that the entire Ray cluster fails. To make the GCS fault tolerant, HA Redis is required.\n\n4. Check the health check frequency: The frequency at which the controller health checks replicas is set by the \"health_check_period_s\" parameter. If this is set to a low value, it might be causing the health check to fail. You can try increasing this value.\n\n5. Check the node status: You can check the status of the nodes in your cluster. If there are any pending nodes or recent failures, it could indicate an issue with the cluster.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, it might be worth reaching out to the Ray community or support for further assistance."

            "answer": "To kill a specific serve replica, you can use the Python interpreter with the Ray library. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Import the Ray library in Python.\n2. Get a handle to the specific serve replica you want to kill. You can do this by using the `ray.get_actor()` function with the name of the replica and the namespace as arguments.\n3. Use the `ray.kill()` function with the handle of the replica and `no_restart=True` as arguments to kill the replica without restarting it.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport ray\nreplica_handle = ray.get_actor(\"SERVE_REPLICA::SleepyPid#RlRptP\", namespace=\"serve\")\nray.kill(replica_handle, no_restart=True)\n```\n\nPlease replace `\"SERVE_REPLICA::SleepyPid#RlRptP\"` with the name of your specific serve replica."
