It reacts to task and actor resource requests, not application metrics or physical resource utilization. When Ray Serve scales down, it tries to terminate replica actors in a way that allows the Ray autoscaler to remove nodes with no Ray actors or tasks running on them.

It's designed for low-latency data processing and supports a wide range of tasks such as batch processing, interactive queries, streaming, machine learning, and graph processing.\n\nRay is a high-performance distributed execution engine that can scale to thousands of nodes and supports a variety of use cases, including machine learning, reinforcement learning, and general distributed computing tasks. Ray's core abstraction is the \"actor,\" which is an object that can perform computations and maintain state. Ray also provides a task-based API that allows users to parallelize and distribute workloads across a cluster.\n\nDask is a flexible parallel computing library for analytic computing, built with the Python ecosystem in mind. It provides big data collections that mimic the APIs of NumPy and Pandas, allowing those abstractions to represent larger-than-memory data and/or allowing operations on that data to be run on a multi-machine cluster. Dask is designed to integrate well with existing Python libraries and tools, and can be used to scale up existing Python codebases.\n\nDask can be used on top of Ray as a scheduler, which allows you to build data analyses using Dask's collections and execute them on a fast, fault-tolerant distributed task execution system geared towards production, like Ray. However, Dask-on-Ray is an ongoing project and is not expected to achieve the same performance as using Ray directly.\n\nRay Data handles many of the same batch processing workloads as Apache Spark, but with a streaming paradigm that is better suited for GPU workloads for deep learning inference.\n\nIn summary, Spark is a general-purpose distributed computing system, Ray is a high-performance distributed execution engine, and Dask is a flexible parallel computing library for analytic computing in Python. Dask can be used on top of Ray to provide a more user-friendly API for distributed computing in Python. Ray Data provides a streaming paradigm for batch processing workloads, which is better suited for GPU workloads for deep learning inference.",

To prevent this, you can reduce the number of concurrent tasks or increase the resources available to them.

These components may take a few seconds to start up after the head Pod is ready. If you continue to encounter this issue after waiting for 1 minute, it's possible that the dashboard or dashboard agent may have failed to start.\n\nTo connect to a remote Ray cluster, you should use `ray.init(address=\"ray://<head_node_ip_address>:10001\")` with the appropriate IP address. Make sure your remote cluster has a similar environment to your local machine, including files, environment variables, and Python packages.\n\nAdditionally, ensure that the Ray Dashboard is running by executing `ray dashboard cluster.yaml` in a separate shell. This command will forward the remote port 8265 to port 8265 on localhost.\n\nIf you still face issues, check if the Ray Cluster is running and accessible using its default HTTP address (http://127.0.0.1:8265 or ray://<head_node_ip_address>:10001).",

This means that the checkpoints and artifacts saved by trials scheduled on worker nodes will not be accessible during or after the run.\n\nAdditionally, be aware that the use of `syncer` and `upload_dir` is deprecated and may be hard-deprecated in Ray 2.7.

For example:\n```\n@serve.deployment(ray_actor_options={\"num_gpus\": 1})\ndef func(*args):\n    return do_something_with_my_gpu()\n```\nThis will create a deployment where each replica uses a single GPU.

If the machine does not have the required number of GPUs available, a `RuntimeError` will be thrown by the respective worker.

A Dataset can operate over a sequence of Ray object references to blocks.\n\nOn the other hand, a batch is a collection of data from multiple rows within a single block. Ray Data represents batches as dicts of NumPy ndarrays by default. You can inspect batches by calling Dataset.take\\_batch() and specify the batch\\_size and batch\\_format.\n\nIn summary, blocks are a higher-level organizational concept for data in Ray Datasets, while batches are a way to group data from multiple rows within a single block.",

            "answer": " In Ray Serve, user config refers to the configuration that can be set for a specific deployment in a Serve application. It can be used to configure parameters such as the name, number of replicas, and route prefix for a deployment. The user config can be set in the Serve config file or on the `@serve.deployment` decorator.\n\nTo use the user config, you can define a `user_config` field in the deployment's entry in the Serve config file. For example:\n```\ndeployments:\n  - name: Model\n    user_config:\n        threshold: 1.5\n```\nAlternatively, you can set the user config when creating the deployment using the `user_config` argument of the `serve.deployment` function.\n\nTo update the user config, you can use the `reconfigure()` method of the deployment object. This method takes a new user config dictionary as an argument and updates the deployment's configuration accordingly.\n\nTo query the current config of a Serve application, you can use the `serve config` command in the Ray CLI. This command will return the latest config file that the Ray Cluster received, which represents the Serve application's goal state.\n\nI hope this helps!

Unique identification: Actors can be given a unique name within their namespace, allowing you to retrieve the actor from any job in the Ray cluster.\n2. Get-or-create functionality: Ray provides a `get_if_exists` option for actor creation that creates an actor only if it doesn\u2019t exist.\n3. Accessibility: Named actors can be accessed and retrieved later, even if you cannot directly pass the actor handle to the task that needs it or if you are trying to access an actor launched by another driver.\n4. Scoping: Named actors are scoped by namespace, and if no namespace is assigned, they will be placed in an anonymous namespace by default.\n\nNamed actors are useful when you need to maintain state and access the actor from different parts of your code or from other jobs in the Ray cluster.

You can adjust the number of retries as needed.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the `ray.tune.Callback.on_trial_error` and `ray.tune.Callback.on_trial_recover` callbacks to customize behavior when a trial fails and is retried.

This is because if the supervisor dies, or the driver, the worker actors are automatically terminated thanks to actor reference counting. This is true even if actors are nested to multiple levels to form a tree. However, you can make the actor's lifetime \"detached\" so that it can persist even after the driver process of the job exits. But this does not prevent the actor from being terminated when the supervisor dies.",

Here's an example:\n```\nimport ray\n\nds = ray.data.read_text(\"s3://your-bucket-name/path/to/your/text-file.txt\")\n```\nThis will create a Ray DataFrame `ds` that contains the text of the file, with one row for each line of text.\n\nYou can also use the `read_binary_files` function to read the raw binary data of the file, and then decode the data manually if needed.\n\nFor example:\n```\nds = ray.data.read_binary_files(\"s3://your-bucket-name/path/to/your/text-file.txt\")\ndecoded_data = ds.map(decode_text)\n```\nWhere `decode_text` is a function that you define to decode the binary data into text.\n\nNote that you can use the `read_csv` function to read compressed text files, such as those with a `.gz` or `.bz2` extension, by specifying the compression type in the `arrow_open_stream_args` argument.

You can use Ray's data APIs to perform operations on the dataset, such as mapping a function to each batch of data in the dataset.\n\nFor more information, see the Ray documentation on converting datasets to pandas and loading data from single-node data libraries.",

However, Ray Tune does not directly support setting a memory limit for each trial. Instead, you can request a certain amount of memory from the Ray cluster when starting it, and then request a fraction of that memory for each trial.\n\nHere's an example of how to set 4GB of memory for each trial:\n\n1. Start the Ray cluster with 8GB of memory per worker:\n```python\nray start --memory 8G\n```\n2. Configure the trial to request 4GB of memory:\n```python\nimport ray\nfrom ray.tune.resources import Resources\n\n# Request 4GB of memory for each trial\ntrial_resources = Resources(memory=4*1024**3)\n\ntrain_model = tune.with_resources(train_model, trial_resources)\n```\n\nNote that this will only work if your cluster has enough memory to allocate 4GB per trial. Also, keep in mind that each Ray worker (and thus each Ray Tune Trial) will only be scheduled on one machine, so you will have to make sure that your Ray cluster has enough resources to schedule all the trials you want to run concurrently.",

Here is an example:\n```\nfrom ray.runtime_context import RuntimeContext\n\ncurrent_actor_id = RuntimeContext.get_actor_id()\nprint(current_actor_id)\n```\nAlternatively, you can use the `actor_id` property from the `ray.runtime_context.RuntimeContext` class, which has the same functionality as `get_actor_id()`.\n\nNote that the `actor_id` property is deprecated and may be removed in future Ray releases, so it is recommended to use `get_actor_id()` instead.\n\nIf you want to get the state of an actor by its ID, you can use the `get_actor()` function from the `ray.util.state` module. This function returns the state of the actor with the given ID, or `None` if the actor is not found. Here is an example:\n```\nfrom ray.util.state import get_actor\n\nactor_state = get_actor(id=\"<ACTOR_ID>\")\nprint(actor_state)\n```\nYou can also use the `ray` CLI to get the state of an actor by its ID. For example:\n```\nray get actors <ACTOR_ID>\n```\nThis will print the state of the actor with the given ID.\n\nFinally, if you want to get the logs of an actor, you can use the `get_log()` function from the `ray.util.state` module. This function returns the logs of the actor with the given ID as an iterator of strings. Here is an example:\n```\nfrom ray.util.state import get_log\n\nfor line in get_log(actor_id=\"<ACTOR_ID>\"):\n    print(line)\n```\nYou can also use the `ray` CLI to get the logs of an actor.

Note that Ray will not automatically retry tasks that have been cancelled.\n\nHere is an example of how to cancel a Ray task:\n```\n@ray.remote\ndef blocking_operation():\n    time.sleep(10e6)\n\nobj_ref = blocking_operation.remote()\nray.cancel(obj_ref)\n\ntry:\n    ray.get(obj_ref)\nexcept ray.exceptions.TaskCancelledError:\n    print(\"Object reference was cancelled.\")\n```\nRay will attempt to cancel tasks on a best-effort basis, meaning cancellation is not always guaranteed. You can check if a task was successfully cancelled by using `ray.get(actor_task_ref)`.\n\nIf you want to cancel all child and Actor tasks, you can pass `recursive=True` to `ray.cancel()`.

You can replace \"some value\" with any value you want to pass to the UDF.\n\nNote that `fn_kwargs` expects a dictionary, so you need to pass the extra arguments as key-value pairs in the dictionary. You can include multiple key-value pairs if you have multiple arguments to pass.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the `fn_kwargs` parameter is only available in the `map_batches` function, not in the `map` function.

To resolve this issue, you can put large objects in the Ray object store using `ray.put()` and retrieve them using `ray.get()` in the actor's constructor.\n\nAdditionally, you may want to consider using actor-based batch prediction to optimize the process. This involves defining a callable class with a constructor to load/cache the model and a method to take in a file and perform prediction. This can help reduce the overhead cost of fetching the model for each task.\n\nIt's also worth noting that if you're using `tune.TuneConfig()`, you cannot use actor-based strategies if `reuse_actors` is set to True. A `ValueError` will be raised in that case.\n\nFinally, ensure that the batch size is not too large for the actor pool size.

Import Ray Train and Ray AIR Session: `import ray.train as train`\n2. Define a training function that accepts a configuration dict with hyperparameters.\n3. Use `ray.train.torch.prepare_model` to wrap the model with DistributedDataParallel and place it on the right device.\n4. Use `ray.train.torch.prepare_data_loader` to set up the DataLoader with DistributedSampler.\n5. Load the data shard for each worker with `session.get_dataset_shard(\"train\")`.\n6. Iterate over the dataset with `train_dataset.iter_torch_batches()`.\n\nHere's an example of how to define the `train_func_distributed` function:\n\n```python\nfrom ray import train\nimport tensorflow as tf  # Your custom neural net model should be defined here\n\ndef train_func_distributed(config):\n    num_epochs = config.get(\"num_epochs\")\n    batch_size = config.get(\"batch_size\")\n\n    # Load your custom neural net model\n    model = YourModel()\n    model = train.torch.prepare_model(model)\n\n    # Set up the data loader\n    dataset = get_dataset()\n    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size)\n    dataloader = train.torch.prepare_data_loader(dataloader)\n\n    # Initialize the optimizer and other training components\n    optimizer = ...\n    lr_scheduler = ...\n\n    # Prepare everything for distributed training\n    (model, optimizer, train_dataloader, eval_dataloader, lr_scheduler) = accelerator.prepare(\n        model, optimizer, train_dataloader, eval_dataloader, lr_scheduler\n    )\n\n    # Start training\n    for epoch in range(num_epochs):\n        for batch in train_dataloader:\n            # Perform a training step\n            ...\n\n    # Report the results back to Ray Train\n    ...\n```\n\nFinally, create a `TorchTrainer` instance and call the `fit` method to start the distributed training:\n\n```python\ntrainer = TorchTrainer(\n    train_func_distributed,\n    scaling_config=ScalingConfig(num_workers=4, use_gpu=use_gpu)\n)\n\nresults = trainer.fit()\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `YourModel` with your custom Keras neural net model and adjust the training code accordingly.",

It's a synchronous (i.e., blocking) operation.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n```python\nimport ray\nray.init()\n\n# Store an object in the object store\nobject_id = ray.put(\"some object\")\n\n# Get the object from the object store\nobject = ray.get(object_id)\n```\n\nNote that calling `ray.get()` unnecessarily can harm performance.

Apply the preprocessors on the dataset before passing the dataset into a Trainer.\n\nAdditionally, if your preprocessed Dataset is small enough to fit in Ray object store memory, you can materialize the preprocessed dataset in Ray\u2019s built-in object store by calling `materialize()` on the preprocessed dataset. This method computes the entire preprocessed dataset and pins it in the Ray object store memory, so when iterating over the dataset repeatedly, the preprocessing operations do not need to be re-run.\n\nRefer to the Ray Data documentation for more information on using Ray Data for preprocessing and ingest for ML training, as well as performance considerations.",

Here is an example of how to do this:\n\n1. Train a model with Ray Train by calling `tune.run()` and passing in an objective function that trains the model and reports the training progress to Ray Tune.\n2. Get the best checkpoint from the results of the Tune run by calling `tune.get_best_checkpoint()`.\n3. Load the trained model from the checkpoint by calling `train.get_checkpoint_to_restore()` and passing in the best checkpoint.\n4. Use the loaded model to make predictions by calling the model's `forward()` method and passing in the input data.\n\nHere is some example code that demonstrates this process:\n\n```python\nfrom ray import tune\nfrom ray.train import TrainConfig, Checkpoint\n\n# Train a model with Ray Train\nresults = tune.run(objective)\n\n# Get the best checkpoint\nbest_checkpoint = tune.get_best_checkpoint(results, metric=\"mean_loss\", mode=\"min\")\n\n# Load the trained model from the checkpoint\ncheckpoint_dir = best_checkpoint.get_best_result().get(\"artifacts\", {}).get(\"checkpoint\", \"\")\ntrain_config = TrainConfig(checkpoint_dir=checkpoint_dir)\nmodel = MyTrainedModel.from_checkpoint(train_config.checkpoint_dir)\n\n# Use the loaded model to make predictions\ninput_data = ...\npredictions = model.forward(input_data)\n```\n\nNote that this is just a general outline of the process, and the specific details will depend on the type of model you are using and how you have implemented your training and inference code.",

However, this function is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I'll describe how to use it based on related functions and concepts.\n\nFirst, you need to define a collective group for the actors. In the provided context, a `Worker` class is defined with a `compute()` method that includes an allreduce operation. You can create actors from this class and add them to a collective group.\n\nHere's an example of how to create a collective group and perform an allreduce operation:\n\n```python\nfrom ray import put, get, worker\n\n# Create two actors A and B and create a collective group\nA = Worker.remote()\nB = Worker.remote()\n\n# Add actors to a collective group\ngroup = worker.get_current_group_membership()\ngroup.add(A)\ngroup.add(B)\n\n# Perform allreduce on a tensor\ntensor_a = put(get(A.buffer.remote()))\ntensor_b = put(get(B.buffer.remote()))\n\nreduced_tensor = ray.util.collective.allreduce(tensor_a, group=group)\n\n# Print the reduced tensor\nprint(reduced_tensor)\n```\n\nThis example assumes that the `Worker` class and the `buffer` attribute are defined as in the provided context. The `put()` function is used to wrap the tensors in a Ray object, and `get()` is used to retrieve the tensor data. The `allreduce()` function is then called with the tensor and the collective group as arguments.\n\nKeep in mind that the `ray.util.collective.allreduce()` function is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, so the above example might not work as-is in your use case. You might need to modify it based on your specific requirements and the available functions in your Ray version.",

Share the Ray cluster across tests if possible.\n3. Create a mini-cluster with `ray.cluster_utils.Cluster`.\n4. Be cautious when running tests in parallel.\n5. Use `ray.init()` and `ray.shutdown()` to start and stop the Ray context.\n6. When testing with Ray Serve, use `Serve.getDeployment(\"deployment_name\")` to get a handle on the deployment.\n7. For normal Ray code, use the `.remote()` function to execute tasks in a different process.\n\nHere's an example of how to write a unit test for Ray code:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\nimport ray\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        ray.shutdown()\n\n    def test_my_ray_code(self):\n        # Initialize your Ray objects here\n        my_object = MyRayObject.remote()\n\n        # Run your tests here\n        result = ray.get(my_object.my_method.remote(arg1, arg2))\n        self.assertEqual(result, expected_result)\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `MyRayObject`, `my_method`, `arg1`, `arg2`, and `expected_result` with your actual Ray objects and test parameters.",

This will prevent task and actor logs from being copied to the driver's stdout.\n2. You can also try setting `RAY_TQDM_PATCH_PRINT=0` to disable the patching of the built-in `print` function, which may improve performance if there are more than a couple thousand updates per second.\n3. Ray deduplicates logs that appear redundantly across multiple processes by default. You can adjust the buffering time for subsequent log messages by changing the relevant configuration settings.\n4. If you are using `ray.get()` to retrieve object references, it may result in spamming of stdout. In such cases, you can try using asyncio or other concurrency primitives to avoid blocking the event loop.\n5. If none of the above steps work, you can try stopping the job using the command `ray job stop raysubmit_tUAuCKubPAEXh6CW` and then re-submit the job with the necessary configuration changes.\n\nRefer to the provided context for more details on each step.",

            "answer": " To kill a detached actor in Ray, you can use the `ray.kill()` function, passing in the actor's handle as an argument. This will immediately terminate the actor, causing any current, pending, and future tasks to fail with a `RayActorError`. Here's an example:\n```python\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    pass\n\nactor_handle = Actor.remote()\n\nray.kill(actor_handle)\n```\nNote that this will not go through the normal teardown logic, so any exit handlers installed in the actor using `std::atexit` or `atexit` will not be called. If you would like Ray to automatically restart the actor, make sure to set a nonzero `max_restarts` in the `@ray.remote` options for the actor, then pass the `flag no_restart=False` to `ray.kill()`.\n\nFor named and detached actors, calling `ray.kill()` on an actor handle destroys the actor and allows the name to be reused. A remote actor will be terminated when all actor handles to it in Python are deleted, which will cause them to complete any outstanding work and then shut down. If you want to kill actors immediately, you can also call `ray.kill(actor)`.\n\nGarbage collection for actors has not been implemented yet, so this is currently the only way to terminate an actor gracefully. The object ref resulting from the task can be waited on to wait for the actor to exit. Note that this method of termination waits until any previously submitted tasks finish executing and then exits the process gracefully with `sys.exit()`.",

The `.remote()` postfix is used for every remote function, remote class declaration, or invocation of a remote class method, and it makes the operation asynchronous. `ray.put()` stores an object in the object store and returns its ID, while `ray.get()` returns an object or list of objects from the object ID or list of object IDs. `ray.wait()` returns two lists of object references, one with finished tasks we\u2019re waiting for and one with unfinished tasks.",

If you want to disable this feature and redirect the logs to a file or another output, you can view the Configuring Logging documentation.\n\nAdditionally, you can customize the prefixes for Actor logs by defining the `__repr__` method for the Actor class to replace the Actor name with a custom string, such as the Actor index. This can be useful for distinguishing between log messages from different Actors.",

To allow the actor to complete its current tasks before terminating, you can call its `__ray_terminate__` method instead of using `ray.kill()`.

The memory usage is measured in RSS - SHR.\n\nIf you are using Ray 2.2 or later, there is an application-level memory monitor that can help prevent out-of-memory errors. You can enable and configure the memory monitor to detect and resolve memory issues.\n\nIf you notice a memory leak on a Serve actor, you can use `memray` to debug the issue. Set the environment variable `RAY_SERVE_ENABLE_MEMORY_PROFILING=1` and run your Serve application. The Serve actors will run a `memray` tracker that logs their memory usage to bin files. You can then use the `memray flamegraph [bin file]` command to generate a flamegraph of the memory usage.\n\nThe `ray memory` command can also be used to help track down object references that may be causing an `ObjectStoreFullError`. Running `ray memory` from the command line while a Ray application is running will give you a dump of all object references that are currently held by the driver, actors, and tasks in the cluster.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the Ray documentation on \"Debugging Out of Memory\" and \"Out-Of-Memory Prevention\".",

For example:\n```\nfrom transformers.trainer_callback import TrainerCallback\n\nclass MyTrainReportCallback(TrainerCallback):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.metrics = {}\n\n    def on_train_begin(self, args, state, control, **kwargs):\n        # Do something at the beginning of training\n        pass\n\n    def on_train_end(self, args, state, control, **kwargs):\n        # Do something at the end of training\n        pass\n\n    def on_step_end(self, args, state, step_output, **kwargs):\n        # Do something at the end of each step\n        pass\n\ntrainer = Trainer(\n    model=model,\n    args=training_args,\n    train_dataset=small_train_ds,\n    eval_dataset=small_eval_ds,\n    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,\n    callbacks=[MyTrainReportCallback()],\n)\n```\nYou can then use the `add_callback` method to add the custom callback to the trainer. The `on_train_begin`, `on_train_end`, and `on_step_end` methods are just examples, and you can override other methods as needed to implement your desired behavior.",

However, the provided context does not include information on how to specify a subnet in the Ray cloud launcher configuration file.\n\nBut, according to the context, it seems that the Ray cloud launcher uses the AWS Python SDK (Boto3) to launch clusters on AWS. Therefore, you can specify a subnet when creating a cluster using Boto3 by including the 'subnet_id' parameter in the 'SubnetId' field of the 'Placement' parameter in the 'create_cluster' function.\n\nHere's an example of how to specify a subnet using Boto3:\n\n```python\nimport boto3\n\nec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')\n\nresponse = ec2.create_cluster(\n    ClusterName='my-cluster',\n    Placement={\n        'AvailabilityZone': 'us-west-2a',\n        'SubnetId': 'subnet-0123456789abcdef0' # replace with your subnet id\n    }\n)\n```\n\nYou can also specify multiple subnets by including a list of subnet ids in the 'SubnetId' field.\n\nNote that this is not specific to the Ray cloud launcher, but rather a general way to specify a subnet when creating an AWS cluster using Boto3. You may need to modify this example to fit your specific use case and configuration file.",

This happens because the dashboard port is not publicly exposed by default when launching a remote Ray cluster.\n\nTo access the Ray Dashboard from outside the head node, you need to set up port forwarding. If you started your remote cluster with the Ray Cluster Launcher, you can use the `ray dashboard` command to set up port forwarding automatically.\n\nHere's an example command to set up port forwarding:\n```css\nray dashboard cluster.yaml\n```\nReplace `cluster.yaml` with the configuration file you used to launch your cluster.\n\nOnce you have set up port forwarding, you should be able to access the Ray Dashboard in your local browser at `localhost:8265`. However, if you are still experiencing issues with the dashboard disappearing or internal refreshes failing, it could be due to network connectivity issues or firewall settings.\n\nMake sure that the port 8265 is open in your security group settings for the head node and that there are no firewalls blocking the connection. You can also try increasing the dashboard's refresh interval or reducing the amount of data displayed in the dashboard to see if that resolves the issue.\n\nAdditionally, it is recommended to set up authentication for the Ray Dashboard for security purposes. You can do this by configuring the `dashboard_auth_token` option in your Ray configuration file or passing it as an argument when starting Ray.",

If you observe any failures or issues in the output of `ray status`, you can check the autoscaler monitor log (`cat /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/monitor.*`) for more details.\n3. If the issue persists, you can try restarting the cluster by running `ray up`. This command will restart all Ray services, which may help resolve any issues.\n4. If you're using Kubernetes to manage your Ray cluster, you can check the status of the pods by running `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`. If the pods are stuck in the \"Pending\" state, you can check for errors and ensure that your Docker resource limits are set high enough.\n5. You can also try increasing the number of nodes in your cluster or reducing the number of actors to free up resources.\n\nIn the provided context, there are no specific errors or issues mentioned that would indicate the cause of the \"pending\" nodes.

This will enable local shuffling during iteration, providing sufficient randomness without requiring a full global shuffle, which can be slow.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nds = ray.data.read_text(\n    \"s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/sms_spam_collection_subset.txt\"\n).randomize_block_order()\n\nlocal_shuffle_buffer_size = 100  # Choose an appropriate size\n\nfor batch in ds.iter_batches(batch_size=1000, local_shuffle_buffer_size=local_shuffle_buffer_size):\n    # Process your batch here\n    pass\n```\n\nThis approach avoids using `map_batches()` with unvectorized operations and instead uses `iter_batches()` with local shuffling for better performance.",

Check for Python-level exceptions: Ray surfaces application-level failures as Python-level exceptions. When a task on a remote worker or actor fails due to a Python-level exception, Ray wraps the original exception in a RayTaskError. This wrapped exception will be thrown to any worker that tries to get the result.\n\n2. Use Ray logging: Ray logging can help you understand system-level behavior and surface application-level details during runtime. Ray Serve uses Python\u2019s standard logging module with a logger named \"ray.serve\". By default, logs are emitted from actors both to stderr and on disk on each node at /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/. In development, logs are streamed to the driver Ray program, so it\u2019s convenient to keep the driver running while debugging.\n\nFor more specific Ray exceptions, you can refer to the ray.exceptions module, which includes errors like RaySystemError, ObjectReconstructionFailedLineageEvictedError, RuntimeEnvSetupError, CrossLanguageError, and others. These exceptions can provide more context when debugging Ray applications.",

For example, `train_dataset.take(10)` will return the first 10 elements of the `train_dataset`. If you want to create a new dataset with a subset of the original, you can use the `ray.data.from_items` function to create a new dataset from a subset of the original dataset's rows. For example:\n\n```\nsubset_dataset = ray.data.from_items(train_dataset.take(10))\n```\n\nThis will create a new dataset `subset_dataset` containing the first 10 elements of the `train_dataset`.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to create a subset of the dataset based on some criteria, you can use the `filter` method to filter the dataset and then create a new dataset from the filtered results. For example, to create a new dataset containing only the elements where the `y` value is greater than 100, you could do:\n\n```\nsubset_dataset = ray.data.from_items(train_dataset.filter(lambda x: x['y'] > 100))\n```\n\nThis will create a new dataset `subset_dataset` containing only the elements where the `y` value is greater than 100.\n\nYou can also use the `map` method to create a new dataset with a modified version of the original elements. For example, to create a new dataset where the `y` value is incremented by 1, you could do:\n\n```\ndef increment(batch):\n    batch[\"y\"] = batch[\"y\"] + 1\n    return batch\n\nsubset_dataset = train_dataset.map_batches(increment)\n```\n\nThis will create a new dataset `subset_dataset` containing the same elements as the `train_dataset`, but with the `y` value incremented by 1.\n\nYou can find more information about these and other Ray Dataset methods in the Ray Data User Guide.",

            "answer": " To kill a \"detached\" Actor in C++, you can use the `Kill()` function of the actor handle. Here is an example:\n\n```\nactor_handle.Kill();\n```\n\nThis will cause the actor to immediately exit its process, causing any current, pending, and future tasks to fail with a `RayActorError`.\n\nIf you want to kill the actor but let pending tasks finish, you can call `actor.__ray_terminate__.remote()` instead. Any atexit handlers installed in the actor will be run in this case.\n\nNote that after calling `ray.kill` on an actor handle, subsequent calls to get its handle via `ray.get_actor` will fail.\n\nIn Python, you can also use the `ray.kill` function to kill an actor forcefully. Here is an example:\n\n```\nray.kill(actor_handle)\n```\n\nThis will interrupt any running tasks on the actor, causing them to fail immediately. Any atexit handlers installed in the actor will not be run.\n\nIf you want to kill the actor but let pending tasks finish, you can call `actor.__ray_terminate__.remote()` instead. Any atexit handlers installed in the actor will be run in this case.\n\nIf the actor is a detached actor, subsequent calls to get its handle via `ray.get_actor` will fail.\n\nNote that garbage collection for actors has not been implemented yet, so this is currently the only way to terminate an actor gracefully. The `ObjectRef` resulting from the task can be waited on to wait for the actor to exit (calling `ObjectRef::Get` on it will throw a `RayActorException`).\n\nNote that this method of termination waits until any previously submitted tasks finish executing and then exits the process gracefully with `sys.exit()`. You can see the actor is dead as a result of the user's `exit_actor()` call by running `ray list actors --detail`.\n\nA remote actor will be terminated when all actor handles to it in Python are deleted, which will cause them to complete any outstanding work and then shut down. If you only have 1 reference to an actor handle, calling `del actor` could trigger actor deletion. Note that your program may have multiple references to the same `ActorHandle`, and actor termination will not occur until the reference count goes to 0.\n\nIf you want to kill actors immediately, you can also call `ray.kill(actor)`.",

For example:\n```\nrayCluster.create(num_workers=1, num_cpus_per_worker=1, num_cpus_for_head=4)\n```\nThis will create a cluster with 1 worker node that has 1 CPU, and a head node with 4 CPUs. You can then check the number of CPUs available in the cluster using `ray.cluster_resources()` as described above.\n\nIt's worth noting that Ray auto-detects the resources available on each node, but you can also manually override this by passing custom resources to the `ray start` command. For example, if you wish to specify that a machine has 10 CPUs and 1 GPU available for use by Ray, you can do this with the flags `--num-cpus=10` and `--num-gpus=1`.\n\nFor more information, see the [Ray documentation](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/).",

This way, the address remains consistent even if the head node IP changes.\n\nThe `RAY_PROMETHEUS_NAME` variable is used to select a different data source to use for the Grafana dashboard panels. You can set this to a different value for each Ray Cluster if you are using a different Prometheus server for each Ray Cluster and the same Grafana server for all Clusters.\n\nNote that the `RAY_GRAFANA_IFRAME_HOST` variable is optional and is used to specify an address that the user's browsers can use to access Grafana and embed visualizations. If this variable is not set, Ray Dashboard uses the value of `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST`.\n\nHere's an example of how to set these variables in a Kubernetes environment:\n\n```yaml\nenv:\n  - name: RAY_GRAFANA_HOST\n    value: http://grafana.example.com\n  - name: RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST\n    value: http://prometheus.example.com\n  - name: RAY_PROMETHEUS_NAME\n    value: Prometheus\n```\n\nReplace `http://grafana.example.com` and `http://prometheus.example.com` with the actual addresses that the head node can use to access Grafana and Prometheus, respectively.

The Ray Autoscaler has more fine-grained control over scale-down than the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, allowing it to select precisely which pods to scale down.

Note that you can also use other parameters like `actor_id`, `task_id`, `pid`, and `suffix` to filter the logs.\n\nIf you want to access the logs of a dead node, you need to store and persist the logs before the node dies.

This will also affect the session directory path. For example:\n```python\nray.init(_temp_dir=\"/path/to/my/custom/temp/dir\")\n```\nThis will set the session directory to `/path/to/my/custom/temp/dir/ray/session_<session_name>`.",

            "answer": " The error message you're seeing, \"Health check failed for node,\" suggests that the worker node is having trouble connecting to the GCS (Global Control Service) running on the head node. This could be due to several reasons, such as:\n\n* The head node is not running or is inaccessible at the specified address.\n* A different version of Ray is running at the specified address.\n* The specified address is wrong.\n* There are firewall settings preventing access.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, you can check if the head node is running and accessible at the specified address. You can also check if there are any firewall settings preventing access. Additionally, you can use a tool such as nmap or nc to check whether each port can be reached from a node.\n\nIf the GCS is not fault tolerant, then a head node failure will cause the entire Ray cluster to fail. To make the GCS fault tolerant, you can use HA Redis. This will allow the GCS to recover its state by reading from Redis when it restarts.\n\nIf you are using Kubernetes but not KubeRay, you can also make the GCS fault tolerant by backing it with Redis. When the GCS restarts, it will recover the state by reading from Redis. If the raylet fails to reconnect to the GCS for more than 60 seconds, the raylet will exit and the corresponding node will fail. This timeout threshold can be tuned by the OS environment variable RAY\\_gcs\\_rpc\\_server\\_reconnect\\_timeout\\_s. You can also set the OS environment variable RAY\\_external\\_storage\\_namespace to isolate the data stored in Redis.",

If using an HDD, specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling.\n4. Monitor disk usage to prevent running out of disk space and triggering `OutOfDiskError`.\n\nObject spilling is enabled by default in Ray 1.3+ and will spill objects to disk if necessary. It is recommended to use Ray's temporary directory in the local filesystem for spilling.",

Ray Workflows does not have a built-in job scheduler, but you can use the Ray Jobs API for job submission and management on a Ray cluster. Jobs are bound to the lifetime of a Ray cluster, and retries or different runs with different parameters should be handled by the submitter.",
