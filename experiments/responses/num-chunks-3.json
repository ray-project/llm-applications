For example:\n```\ntensorboard --logdir=~/ray_results\n```\nThis will start TensorBoard and load the results from the `ray_results` directory.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `tensorboardX` library to log the results to TensorBoard. This library provides a more convenient way to log results from multiple distributed workers.\n\nTo use `tensorboardX`, you can install it using pip:\n```\npip install tensorboardX\n```\nThen, you can log the results to TensorBoard by calling the `tensorboardX.SummaryWriter` class and passing it the directory where the results are stored. For example:\n```\nimport tensorboardX as tbx\n\n# Create a SummaryWriter\nwriter = tbx.SummaryWriter(log_dir='~/ray_results')\n\n# Log the results to TensorBoard\nwriter.add_scalar('loss', loss, global_step=global_step)\n```\nThis will log the `loss` value to TensorBoard, along with the `global_step` value. You can use the `add_scalar` method to log other types of data, such as images or histograms.\n\nNote that you can customize the directory of results by specifying `air.RunConfig(storage_path=..)` in your code.

This parameter takes a `FailureConfig` object, which specifies the maximum number of failures allowed for a trial.\n\nFor example, to retry a trial up to 3 times in case of a runtime error, you can set `max_failures=3` in the `FailureConfig` object. Similarly, to retry all trials that lived on a node that failed (e.g., pre-empted or lost connection) up to 3 times, you can set `max_node_failures=3` in the `FailureConfig` object.\n\nHere's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use the `failure_config` parameter to enable fault tolerance in Ray Tune:\n```python\nimport ray\nfrom ray.tune import Tuner, Trainable\n\n# Define the trainable function\ndef train_model(config):\n    # Train the model using the config\n    return {\"loss\": 0.1}\n\n# Define the parameter space\ntrial_space = {\"num_epochs\": 10}\n\n# Create a Tuner object\ntuner = Tuner(train_model, param_space=trial_space)\n\n# Set the failure configuration\ntuner.run_config = TrainConfig(\n    storage_path=os.path.expanduser(\"~/ray_results\"),\n    name=\"trial_fault_tolerance\",\n    failure_config=FailureConfig(max_failures=3, max_node_failures=3)\n)\n\n# Start the Tune run\nresults = tuner.fit()\n```\nIn this example, the `failure_config` parameter is set to `FailureConfig(max_failures=3, max_node_failures=3)`, which means that Ray Tune will retry a trial up to 3 times in case of a runtime error, and retry all trials that lived on a node that failed up to 3 times. The `max_failures` parameter specifies the maximum number of failures allowed for a trial, while the `max_node_failures` parameter specifies the maximum number of failures allowed for a node.",

Increase the `object_store_memory` parameter in `tune.TuneConfig()` to a larger value, such as `10.0 GiB`. This will allow the actor to store larger objects in the object store.\n2. Use `ray.put()` to put large objects in the Ray object store, as suggested in the warning message. This will allow the actor to store the objects in the object store instead of in its own memory.\n3. Reduce the size of the objects being captured by the actor. This can be done by reducing the size of the data being passed to the actor or by using a more efficient data structure.\n4. Disable `reuse_actors` in `tune.TuneConfig()` if it is not necessary for your use case. This will allow the actor to be recreated for each trial, which may help to avoid the issue.",

Install Ray Train and TensorFlow packages: `pip install -U \"ray[train]\" tensorflow`\n2. Set up your dataset and model.\n3. Define a Predictor class for inference.\n4. Use Ray Train to distribute the training.\n\nHere is an example code snippet:\n```python\nimport ray\nfrom ray.train import TorchTrainer\nfrom ray.data import from_numpy\n\n# Step 1: Create a Ray Dataset from in-memory Numpy arrays.\nds = ray.data.from_numpy(np.ones((1, 100)))\n\n# Step 2: Define a Predictor class for inference.\nclass TorchPredictor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Load a dummy neural network.\n        # Set `self.model` to your pre-trained PyTorch model.\n        self.model = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Linear(in_features=100, out_features=1),\n            nn.Sigmoid(),\n        )\n        self.model.eval()\n\n# Step 3: Use Ray Train to distribute the training.\ntrainer = TorchTrainer(\n    train_func_distributed,\n    scaling_config=ScalingConfig(num_workers=4, use_gpu=use_gpu)\n)\nresults = trainer.fit()\n```\nIn this example, `train_func_distributed` is a function that takes a dataset and a model as input and performs the training. The `ScalingConfig` object is used to specify the number of workers and whether to use GPUs. The `TorchPredictor` class is used to define the inference logic.\n\nNote that this is just an example, and you will need to modify it to fit your specific use case.

The `all_reduce` function takes two arguments: the first is a list of actors, and the second is the name of the reduce operation to perform.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.util.state.list_actors` function to filter the actors based on certain criteria, such as their state or the number of tasks they have completed. For example:\n```\n# List the actors in the cluster that are in the PENDING state\nactors = ray.util.state.list_actors(filters=[(\"state\", \"PENDING\")])\n\n# Perform the all-reduce operation among the actors\nray.util.state.all_reduce(actors, \"my_reduce_operation\")\n```\nIn this example, the `ray.util.state.list_actors` function is used to list the actors in the cluster that are in the PENDING state, and the `ray.util.state.all_reduce` function is used to perform the all-reduce operation among the actors.",

The `test_ray_function` method is where you can write the actual test for your Ray function.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.cluster_utils.Cluster` class to create a mini-cluster for testing purposes.

The YAML file should include the following information:\n\t* The name of the Ray cluster\n\t* The version of Ray to use\n\t* Whether to enable in-tree autoscaling\n\t* Any other configuration options you want to specify\n2. Apply the RayCluster CR: Once you have created the RayCluster CR, you can apply it to the Kubernetes cluster using the `kubectl apply` command.\n3. Manage the Ray cluster: After applying the RayCluster CR, you can use the KubeRay operator to manage the Ray cluster. The KubeRay operator will create and manage the Ray pods in the cluster, and will ensure that the cluster is running and healthy.\n\nFor more information on how to configure and manage a Ray cluster on Kubernetes, you can refer to the RayCluster Configuration guide and the RayCluster Quickstart guide.",

Expose the Ray Dashboard port on the head node by adding the following line to the `ray.yaml` file:\n```\ndashboard_port: 8265\n```\n2. Set up port forwarding to access the Ray Dashboard from outside the head node. You can do this by running the following command:\n```\nray dashboard cluster.yaml\n```\nThis will automatically set up port forwarding and make the remote dashboard viewable in your local browser at `localhost:8265`.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the `ray status` command to monitor the cluster usage and auto-scaling status. This command will show you the current status of the cluster, including the number of nodes and the status of each node. You can run this command on the head node to see live updates to the status.",
