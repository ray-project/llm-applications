It provides a scheduler for Dask (dask_on_ray) which allows you to use Dask's collections and execute them on Ray.\n\nDask is a Python library that provides big data collections and mimics the APIs of NumPy and Pandas. It allows you to work with larger-than-memory data and run operations on a multi-machine cluster. Dask also provides automatic data parallelism, smart scheduling, and optimized operations.\n\nWhile Dask-on-Ray allows you to use Dask's abstractions on top of Ray, it is an ongoing project and may not achieve the same performance as using Ray directly. However, Dask's abstractions should run seamlessly on top of Ray using this scheduler.\n\nFor a more detailed performance comparison between Ray, Spark, and other frameworks like SageMaker, you can refer to the mentioned resource \"Offline Batch Inference: Comparing Ray, Apache Spark, and SageMaker\".",

Reproduce the situation by creating a Kubernetes cluster with an 8-CPUs node and using the provided ray-service.insufficient-resources.yaml file.\n\n3. If your program freezes, you can restart the Ray cluster without running any installation commands using the command: `$ ray up CLUSTER.YAML --restart-only`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with pending nodes in your Ray cluster.",
