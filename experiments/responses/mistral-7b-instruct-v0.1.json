The Ray autoscaler is a Ray cluster process that adjusts the number of nodes in the cluster based on the resources required by tasks, actors or placement groups. The autoscaler reacts to task and actor resource requests and tries to increase the number of worker nodes when resource demands exceed the current capacity of the cluster. When worker nodes sit idle, the autoscaler removes them from the cluster. Similarly, when Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it tries to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes. The Ray autoscaler uses the logical resources expressed in task and actor annotations, similar to the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler, which makes scaling decisions based on the logical resources expressed in container resource requests.",

Ray doesn't provide CPU isolation for tasks or actors, and tasks that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM. Ray prefers available nodes that have large task arguments local to avoid transferring data over the network, but this takes precedence over the \"DEFAULT\" scheduling strategy, which means Ray will try to run the task on the locality preferred node regardless of the node resource utilization.

It is framework-agnostic, meaning you can use a single toolkit to serve everything from deep learning models built with frameworks like PyTorch, Tensorflow, and Keras, to Scikit-Learn models, to arbitrary Python business logic. Ray Serve has several features and performance optimizations for serving large language models such as response streaming, dynamic request batching, multi-node/multi-GPU serving, etc. It is particularly well suited for model composition and scaling by allowing multiple independent deployments to call into each other. Ray Serve enables flexible model composition and scaling by allowing multiple independent deployments to call into each other. When binding a deployment, you can include references to other bound deployments. Then, at runtime each of these arguments is converted to a ServeHandle that can be used to query the deployment using a Python-native API. Ray Serve is well suited for model composition, enabling you to build a complex inference service consisting of multiple ML models and business logic all in Python code. It supports complex model deployment patterns requiring the orchestration of multiple Ray actors, where different actors provide inference for different models. Ray Serve handles both batch and online inference and can scale to thousands of models in production.",

Blocks are used for parallel processing of data, while batches are used for user-facing operations. The batch format specifies the way Ray Data represents batches of data, and the batch size specifies the number of data points used to compute and apply one gradient update to the model weights. The `ray.data.Dataset.map_batches()` method is used for batch training, which creates the same model(s) for different and separate datasets or subsets of a dataset. The `ray.data.block.BlockAccessor.batch_to_block()` method is used to create a block from user-facing data formats. It is important to ensure that no single item in your Ray Data is too large and to call `ds.map_batches()` with a batch size small enough to comfortably fit into memory to avoid out-of-memory situations.",

By using key pools, you can reduce the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node, which can improve resource utilization and performance.",

The `metric` parameter is the key for checkpoints to order on, the `mode` parameter is one of `\"min\"` or `\"max\"`, and the `trial` parameter is the log directory or an instance of a trial.\n\nTo use this function, you can call it with the desired metric, mode, and trial, like this:\n```\nbest_checkpoint = ray.tune.get_best_checkpoint(metric=\"training_iteration\", mode=\"max\", trial=best_result)\n```\nThis will return the checkpoint path of the best trial of the experiment, determined by comparing the last trial results using the metric and mode parameters passed to `tune.run()`.

We then call the `set_global_var` method on the `GlobalVarActor` instance to set its global variable to 4.\n\nWe then use the `pickle` module to serialize the `actor` instance to a file called `actor.pickle`. We can then load the `actor` instance back from the file using the `pickle.load` method.\n\nFinally, we call the `f` method on the `actor` instance to get its output.",

This function takes a tensor, destination rank, group name, and reduction operation as input parameters. The function reduces the tensor across the group to the destination rank.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `reduce` function:\n```python\nimport ray\n\n# Create a list of actors\nactors = [ray.remote(num_gpus=1)(Worker)] * 10\n\n# Create a collective group\ngroup_name = \"my_group\"\nray.util.collective.collective.barrier(group_name)\n\n# Reduce a tensor across the group\ntensor = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nreduced_tensor = ray.util.collective.collective.reduce(tensor, dst_rank=0, group_name=group_name, op=torch.distributed.distributed_c10d.ReduceOp.SUM)\n\nprint(reduced_tensor)  # Output: tensor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n```\nIn this example, we create a list of 10 workers, each of which is a remote function that computes a value. We then create a collective group using the `barrier` function and reduce a tensor across the group using the `reduce` function. The `reduce` function takes the tensor, destination rank (which is 0 in this case), group name, and reduction operation (which is `torch.distributed.distributed_c10d.ReduceOp.SUM` in this case) as input parameters. The function returns the reduced tensor.",

If you are calling `ray.get()` multiple times, try to pass a list of object references to `ray.get()` instead of calling it one by one. This will allow all remote functions to be spawned before waiting for the results and can run in parallel in the background.\n3. If you are still experiencing issues, try to set a timeout to return early from a `get` that is blocking for too long. This can help prevent the program from hanging indefinitely.\n4.

            "answer": " The GCS server is a centralized metadata server for a Ray cluster that runs on the Ray head node. It manages node membership and actor directory, and is also known as the Global Control Store. The head node is a node that runs extra cluster-level processes like GCS and API server in addition to those processes running on a worker node.\n\nThe GCS server is taking up so much memory on the head node because it stores all the cluster-level metadata in-memory. To make the GCS fault tolerant, HA Redis is required, which loads all the data from the Redis instance and resumes regular functions during the recovery period. During this period, certain functions like actor creation, deletion and reconstruction, placement group creation, deletion and reconstruction, and resource management are not available.\n\nTo configure the head node, a good starting hardware specification is 8 CPUs and 32 GB memory. The actual hardware specification depends on the workload and the size of the cluster. Metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, and network bandwidth usage are useful for deciding the hardware specification. The most heavily stressed resource on the head node is outbound bandwidth.\n\nTo tolerate head node failures, GCS needs to be made fault tolerant so that when a new head node is started, all the cluster-level data is still available. This can be achieved by deploying the Ray application with KubeRay, which adds fault tolerance to Ray's Global Control Store (GCS).",

Check the Ray cluster logs using the `cat /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/monitor.*` command.

The `wrapper` function is created by calling `ConcurrencyLimiter.run` with the `func` argument. The `run` method schedules the task and returns the result. The `result` method is used to get the result of the scheduled task.\n\nNote that the `set_max_concurrency` method is called on the wrapped searcher by the `ConcurrencyLimiter`. This allows you to set the maximum number of concurrent tasks for the searcher. If you don't set the maximum number of concurrent tasks, the `ConcurrencyLimiter` will use the default value of 1.",

This will connect to the latest Ray cluster.\n\nTo manually set up a Ray cluster, you can use the `ray up` command with a configuration file.

If `RAY_GRAFANA_IFRAME_HOST` is not set, Ray Dashboard uses the value of `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST`. The `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST` variable should be set to an address that the head node can use to access Prometheus.\n\nIf Prometheus and Grafana are not running on your Head node, you can set these variables to point to the appropriate IP addresses and ports of your Prometheus and Grafana servers.\n\nIf you are using KubeRay, you can set these variables in the `ray-cluster.embed-grafana.yaml` file.

Import this dashboard to your Grafana. If Grafana reports that the datasource is not found, add a datasource variable.

To investigate why particular nodes don't autoscale down, you can run ray status -v. When deploying a large cluster, the head node has extra stress due to additional system processes running on it like GCS. A good starting hardware specification for the head node is 8 CPUs and 32 GB memory. The autoscaler only considers logical resource requests for scaling, not physical machine utilization. Memory usage on a node can be caused by running out of memory while processing tasks or objects. To reduce workload costs, you can use autoscaling, but it adds node launch overheads and can be tricky to configure.",
