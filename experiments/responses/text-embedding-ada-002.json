You can use the `@ray.remote(scheduling_strategy=\"SPREAD\")` decorator to specify this strategy for a remote function or actor.\n\nFor example:\n```\n@ray.remote(scheduling_strategy=\"SPREAD\")\ndef spread_func() -> int:\n    return 2\n\n# Spread tasks across the cluster.\n[spread_func.remote() for _ in range(10)]\n\n# Spread actors across the cluster.\nactors = [SpreadActor.options(scheduling_strategy=\"SPREAD\").remote() for _ in range(10)]\n```\nAlternatively, you can use placement groups to spread actors across the cluster. Placement groups allow you to reserve groups of resources across multiple nodes and schedule tasks and actors packed as close as possible for locality or spread apart.\n\nFor example:\n```\n# Create a placement group with the \"SPREAD\" strategy.\npg = ray.util.placement_group(strategy=\"SPREAD\")\n\n# Create a remote function that uses the placement group.\n@ray.remote(placement_group=pg)\ndef spread_func() -> int:\n    return 2\n\n# Spread tasks across the cluster using the placement group.\n[spread_func.remote() for _ in range(10)]\n```\nIt's important to note that the \"SPREAD\" strategy is not always the best choice for all workloads.

Check that the Ray Dashboard is running and accessible from the client machine by visiting the dashboard URL in a web browser.\n2. Make sure that the Ray cluster is properly configured to allow external connections. This can be done by setting the `RAY_ADDRESS` environment variable to the address of the Ray cluster, or by passing the `--address` flag to the `ray start` command.\n3. If you are using a Ray Cluster started on VMs or Kubernetes, you can follow the instructions there for setting up network access from a client.\n4.

The `TensorBoard` object is then used to log the results to a directory called \"logs\".\n\nNote that only the results from rank 0 worker will be used. However, in order to ensure consistency, `train.report()` has to be called on each worker. If you want to aggregate results from multiple workers, you can use the `train.aggregate_results()` method to aggregate the results from all workers.",

The `syncer` parameter is set to `None`, which means that the default syncer will be used.\n\nYou can also use a network filesystem mounted on all nodes as the storage path, and set the `sync_config` parameter to a `SyncConfig` object with the `upload_dir` parameter set to the NFS mount point.\n\nNote that you should only use a network filesystem mounted on all nodes if you are sure that the filesystem is available and accessible from all nodes in the cluster.",

The error message mentions that the rollout workers are deadlocking, which could be caused by a variety of factors, such as resource constraints or issues with the Ray cluster.\n\nTo debug the issue, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Check the Ray cluster status to ensure that there are enough resources available for the rollout workers. You can use the `ray status` command to check the cluster status.\n2. Check the Ray worker logs to see if there are any error messages or warnings that could indicate the cause of the deadlock. You can use the `ray logs` command to view the worker logs.\n3. Try reducing the number of rollout workers or increasing the resources available to each worker. This can be done by adjusting the `num_rollout_workers` and `num_cpus` parameters in the `RolloutWorker` constructor.\n4. If the issue persists, you can try using the `ray stack` command to dump the stack traces of all Ray workers on the current node, and the `ray timeline` command to dump a timeline visualization of tasks to a file. This can help you identify any performance bottlenecks or other issues that may be causing the deadlock.\n5. If you are using a Tune scheduler, you can try adjusting the `num_workers` and `num_cpus` parameters in the Tune scheduler configuration to ensure that there are enough resources available for the rollout workers.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue causing the rollout workers to deadlock.",

The configuration file is written in YAML and contains information such as the host, port, and request timeout for the HTTP server, as well as the name, route prefix, import path, and runtime environment for each deployment.\n\nTo use the user config in Ray Serve, you can generate a config file using the `serve build` command and then deploy it using the `serve deploy` command. You can also update the user config by issuing lightweight updates to the deployments using the `reconfigure()` method.\n\nFor more details, you can check out the other pages in the production guide, such as the section on Understanding the Serve config file format, or the section on Deploying on Kubernetes using KubeRay.",

The `use_gpu` parameter is set to True, indicating that each worker should use a GPU. These parameters are passed to the Tuner constructor along with the TuneConfig object and the RunConfig object.\n\nNote that the ScalingConfig object can also be used to specify other resources, such as memory and custom resources, and to control the placement of workers on different nodes.

This will allow the workers to read the numpy array in the object store without copying it.\n\nHere's an example:\n```\nimport ray\nimport numpy as np\n\nray.init()\n\n# Create a numpy array\narr = np.ones((100, 100))\n\n# Store the numpy array in the object store\narr_ref = ray.put(arr)\n\n# Pass the object reference to the workers\n@ray.remote\ndef func(arr_ref):\n    # Get the numpy array from the object store\n    arr = ray.get(arr_ref)\n    # Do some computation on the numpy array\n    return arr.sum()\n\n# Call the remote function\nresult = ray.get(func.remote(arr_ref))\n\nprint(result)\n```\nIn this example, the `ray.put()` function is used to store the numpy array `arr` in the object store, and the object reference `arr_ref` is passed to the remote function `func`. The remote function `func` retrieves the numpy array from the object store using `ray.get(arr_ref)`, and then performs some computation on the numpy array. The result of the computation is returned to the driver program using `ray.get(func.remote(arr_ref))`.\n\nNote that the `ray.put()` function is only necessary if you want to store the numpy array in the object store. If you don't need to store the numpy array in the object store, you can simply pass the numpy array to the remote function as an argument.",

Unique name within the namespace: A named actor can be given a unique name within its namespace, which allows it to be retrieved from any job in the Ray cluster.\n2. Accessibility: The named actor can be accessed from any job in the Ray cluster, as long as the namespace is known.\n3. Garbage collection: The named actor will still be garbage-collected if no handles to it exist.\n4. Namespace support: Named actors are scoped by namespace, and the name must be unique within the namespace.\n5. Job-scope-unique name: In C++, named actors can be given a job-scope-unique name, which means that the actor name is only valid within the job and cannot be accessed from another job.\n6. Better than tasks: If you don't need the stateful part of an actor, you're mostly better off using tasks.",

This class allows you to configure the behavior of trials when they fail, including the number of retries and the exceptions that should be retried.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `FailureConfig` to enable retries for a trial:\n```\nfrom ray import train, tune\n\n# Define a trainable that implements trial checkpoint saving and loading\ntrainable = train.Trainable(\n    ...\n)\n\n# Configure the failure handling for the trial\nfailure_config = tune.FailureConfig(\n    max_retries=3,  # Retry the trial up to 3 times\n    retry_exceptions=[RuntimeError],  # Retry only on RuntimeError\n)\n\n# Create a trial with the failure config\ntrial = tune.Trial(\n    trainable=trainable,\n    failure_config=failure_config,\n)\n```\nIn this example, the `FailureConfig` class is used to configure the failure handling for the trial. The `max_retries` parameter is set to 3, which means that the trial will be retried up to 3 times if it fails. The `retry_exceptions` parameter is set to `[RuntimeError]`, which means that only `RuntimeError` exceptions will be retried.\n\nWhen a trial fails, Ray Tune will automatically restart it from the latest checkpointed state. If no checkpoint is found, the trial will restart from scratch. You can configure the checkpointing behavior using the `checkpoint_config` parameter in the `Trial` constructor.\n\nNote that the `FailureConfig` class is only available in Ray Tune 1.0 and later. In earlier versions of Ray Tune, you can use the `max_retries` and `retry_exceptions` parameters in the `ray.remote` decorator to configure the failure handling for a trial.",

Here's an example:\n```\nimport ray\n\nds = ray.data.read_text(\"s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/this.txt\")\n```\nThis will read the text file from S3 and create a Ray dataset with one row for each line of text in the file. You can then use the `map` function to perform any necessary transformations on the data.\n\nNote that you will need to have the necessary credentials to access the S3 bucket. You can do this by setting the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables, or by using a credentials file.",

This function takes a pandas DataFrame as input and returns a Ray dataset.\n\nHere is an example of how to use this function:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport ray\n\n# Create a pandas DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\"col1\": [1, 2, 3], \"col2\": [4, 5, 6]})\n\n# Convert the pandas DataFrame to a Ray dataset\nds = ray.data.from_pandas(df)\n\n# Print the schema of the Ray dataset\nprint(ds.schema())\n```\nThis will output the schema of the Ray dataset, which should match the schema of the original pandas DataFrame.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.data.read_csv()` function to read a CSV file into a Ray dataset. This function takes the path to the CSV file as input and returns a Ray dataset.\n\nHere is an example of how to use this function:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Read a CSV file into a Ray dataset\nds = ray.data.read_csv(\"data.csv\")\n\n# Print the schema of the Ray dataset\nprint(ds.schema())\n```\nThis will output the schema of the Ray dataset, which should match the schema of the CSV file.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.data.from_numpy()` function to create a Ray dataset from a NumPy array. This function takes a NumPy array as input and returns a Ray dataset.\n\nHere is an example of how to use this function:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n\n# Create a NumPy array\narray = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n\n# Convert the NumPy array to a Ray dataset\nds = ray.data.from_numpy(array)\n\n# Print the schema of the Ray dataset\nprint(ds.schema())\n```\nThis will output the schema of the Ray dataset, which should match the schema of the NumPy array.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.data.from_dask()` function to create a Ray dataset from a Dask DataFrame. This function takes a Dask DataFrame as input and returns a Ray dataset.\n\nHere is an example of how to use this function:\n```\nimport dask.dataframe as dd\nimport ray\n\n# Create a Dask DataFrame\ndf = dd.read_csv(\"data.csv\")\n\n# Convert the Dask DataFrame to a Ray dataset\nds = ray.data.from_dask(df)\n\n# Print the schema of the Ray dataset\nprint(ds.schema())\n```\nThis will output the schema of the Ray dataset, which should match the schema of the Dask DataFrame.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.data.from_torch()` function to create a Ray dataset from a PyTorch dataset. This function takes a PyTorch dataset as input and returns a Ray dataset.\n\nHere is an example of how to use this function:\n```\nimport torchvision.datasets as datasets\nimport ray\n\n# Create a PyTorch dataset\ndataset = datasets.MNIST(root=\"./data\", train=True, download=True)\n\n# Convert the PyTorch dataset to a Ray dataset\nds = ray.data.from_torch(dataset)\n\n# Print the schema of the Ray dataset\nprint(ds.schema())\n```\nThis will output the schema of the Ray dataset, which should match the schema of the PyTorch dataset.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.data.from_mars()` function to create a Ray dataset from a Mars DataFrame.

For example:\n```\nds.iter_batches(batch_size=2).map_batches(assert_batch)\n```\nThis will apply the `assert_batch` function to each batch of size 2 in parallel using the default number of actors.\n\nIt's important to note that the batch size should be chosen carefully to avoid out-of-memory issues. A larger batch size can result in faster execution, but it may also lead to potential out-of-memory situations.

This function takes in a list of actor handles and performs an all-reduce operation on the data stored in the actors.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `ray.util.collective.allreduce` to perform an all-reduce operation among a list of actors:\n```\nimport ray\nimport cupy\nimport ray.util.collective as col\n\n# Create two actors A and B and create a collective group\nA = Worker.remote()\nB = Worker.remote()\ncol.create_collective_group(A, B)\n\n# Invoke allreduce remotely\nray.get([A.compute.remote(), B.compute.remote()])\n```\nIn this example, `A` and `B` are two actors that have a `compute` method that performs a computation on the data stored in the actor. The `col.create_collective_group` function is used to create a collective group of actors that can communicate with each other. The `ray.get` function is used to invoke the `compute` method on the actors and perform the all-reduce operation.\n\nNote that the `ray.util.collective` module provides a number of other functions for performing collective operations among actors, such as `allgather`, `broadcast`, and `reduce`. These functions can be used in a similar way to perform other types of collective operations.",

Workflows allow you to write asynchronous code that can be executed in parallel, and they provide strong durability guarantees. This means that if a workflow fails, it will be re-executed from scratch, ensuring that the results are accurate and reliable.\n\nTo use workflows with async.io, you can launch a workflow from within a Ray task or actor. This allows you to write asynchronous code that can be executed in parallel, while still benefiting from the durability guarantees provided by Ray.\n\nIt's worth noting that workflows are compatible with Ray tasks and actors, so you can use them together in a single task or actor.

This will terminate the actor.\n\nNote that `ray.actor.exit_actor()` is a blocking call, so the actor will not be terminated until the call to `exit_actor()` returns.

This method returns a string representation of the Actor that can be used to distinguish between different Actors. For example:\n```\nimport ray\nimport logging\n\n@ray.remote\nclass MyActor:\n    def __init__(self, index):\n        self.index = index\n        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n    def foo(self):\n        self.logger.info(\"Hello from MyActor!\")\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"MyActor(index={self.index})\"\n```\nIn this example, we define a `MyActor` class with a `foo` method that logs a message using the `info` level.

If you specify a local directory, the contents of the directory will be directly accessed as the working directory. If you specify a remote URI, the contents of the zip file will be directly accessed as the working directory.\n\nTo specify multiple working directories, you can use the `working_dir` key in the runtime environment dictionary and provide a list of directories or URIs as the value. For example:\n```\nruntime_env = {\n    \"working_dir\": [\"/some_path/example_dir\", \"/some_other_path/example_dir\"]\n}\n```\nAlternatively, you can use the `working_dir` key with a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary specifies a single working directory and its corresponding remote URI. For example:\n```\nruntime_env = {\n    \"working_dir\": [\n        {\"local_dir\": \"/some_path/example_dir\"},\n        {\"remote_uri\": \"https://example.com/example_dir.zip\"}\n    ]\n}\n```\nNote that if you specify multiple working directories, the behavior of changing the working directory can be disabled by setting the `RAY_CHDIR_TO_TRIAL_DIR` environment variable to `0`.

This can be done using the following command:\n```\nRAY_scheduler_spread_threshold=0.0 ray start --head --num-cpus=0\n```\nThis will ensure that tasks are not scheduled on the head node, and will instead be spread across the cluster.\n\nAlternatively, you can set the `scheduler_spread_threshold` parameter to a value less than 1.0 to tell the scheduler to prefer spreading tasks across the cluster instead of packing them onto a single node. This can be done using the following command:\n```\nRAY_scheduler_spread_threshold=0.5 ray start --head\n```\nThis will set the scheduler to prefer spreading tasks across the cluster, but will still allow tasks to be scheduled on a single node if there is no other option.\n\nIt is important to note that these settings only affect the scheduling of tasks and do not limit the number of tasks that can be run on a single node. If you want to limit the number of tasks that can be run on a single node, you should use the `resources` parameter when defining your tasks. For example:\n```\n@ray.remote(num_cpus=1)\ndef my_task():\n    # Do some work\n```\nThis will ensure that only one task can be run on a single node at a time, regardless of the number of CPUs available on the node.",

            "answer": "  To create an actor instance with parameters in Ray, you can use the `ActorClass.remote()` method and pass the parameters as arguments to the constructor. For example:\n```\n# Define the Counter actor.\n@ray.remote\nclass Counter:\n    def __init__(self, initial_value):\n        self.i = initial_value\n\n    def get(self):\n        return self.i\n\n    def incr(self, value):\n        self.i += value\n\n# Create a Counter actor with an initial value of 10.\ncounter = Counter.remote(10)\n```\nIn this example, the `Counter` actor is defined with a constructor that takes an initial value as a parameter. When we create an instance of the `Counter` actor using `Counter.remote(10)`, Ray will start a remote instance of the `Counter` actor with an initial value of 10.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.actor` function to create actors from regular Java classes. For example:\n```\n// A regular Java class.\npublic class Counter {\n\n    private int value = 0;\n\n    public int increment() {\n        this.value += 1;\n        return this.value;\n    }\n}\n\n// Create an actor from this class.\n// `ray.actor` takes a factory method that can produce\n// a `Counter` object. Here, we pass `Counter`'s constructor\n// as the argument.\nActorHandle<Counter> counter = ray.actor(Counter::new).remote();\n```\nIn this example, the `Counter` class is defined with a constructor that takes no arguments. When we create an instance of the `Counter` actor using `ray.actor(Counter::new).remote()`, Ray will start a remote instance of the `Counter` actor with a default value of 0.\n\nYou can also use the `ray::Actor` function to create actors from regular C++ classes. For example:\n```\n// A regular C++ class.\nclass Counter {\n\nprivate:\n    int value = 0;\n\npublic:\n    int increment() {\n        this->value += 1;\n        return this->value;\n    }\n};\n\n// Create an actor from this class.\n// `ray::Actor` takes a factory method that can produce\n// a `Counter` object. Here, we pass `Counter`'s constructor\n// as the argument.\nActorHandle<Counter> counter = ray::Actor(CreateCounter).remote();\n```\nIn this example, the `Counter` class is defined with a constructor that takes no arguments. When we create an instance of the `Counter` actor using `ray::Actor(CreateCounter).remote()`, Ray will start a remote instance of the `Counter` actor with a default value of 0.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.getActor` function to retrieve an actor instance by its name. For example:\n```\n// Create an actor with a name.\nActorHandle<Counter> counter = ray.actor(Counter::new).setName(\"some_name\").remote();\n\n...\n\n// Retrieve the actor later somewhere\nOptional<ActorHandle<Counter>> counter = ray.getActor(\"some_name\");\nAssert.assertTrue(counter.isPresent());\n```\nIn this example, we create an instance of the `Counter` actor with a name of \"some_name\". Later, we can retrieve the actor instance using `ray.getActor(\"some_name\")`. If the actor instance exists, `ray.getActor` will return an `Optional` containing the actor handle. If the actor instance does not exist, `ray.getActor` will return an empty `Optional`.",

The `MyActor` class is defined to use the `my_module` module, and an instance of the actor is created using `MyActor.remote()`. The `do_something` method of the actor calls a method of the `my_module` module.\n\nNote that the `py_modules` field in the `runtime_env` parameter is a list of Python modules, so you can pass multiple modules if needed. Also, the `ray.get_module()` function is used to load the module, but you can also use other methods to load the module, such as `importlib.import_module()`.",

This is a known issue, and there are a few things you can try to resolve it.\n\nFirst, make sure that you have set up port forwarding correctly. You can do this using the `ray dashboard` command, as described in the documentation.\n\nIf that doesn't work, you can try using a different port for the dashboard. You can do this by passing the `--dashboard-port` argument to `ray start` or `ray.init()`, as described in the documentation.\n\nIf you are still having trouble, you may want to try using a different browser or clearing your browser cache.\n\nI hope this helps!

Check the status of the Ray cluster using the `ray status` command. This will provide information about the current state of the cluster, including any pending or failed nodes.\n2. If there are pending nodes, you can use the `kubectl describe` command to get more information about the pending nodes and any errors that may have occurred. For example, you can run `kubectl describe rayservice rayservice-sample` to get more information about the pending nodes in the `rayservice-sample` Ray cluster.\n3. If the issue persists, you can try restarting the Ray cluster using the `--restart-only` flag. This will restart the Ray cluster without running any of the installation commands. For example, you can run `ray up CLUSTER.YAML --restart-only` to restart the `CLUSTER.YAML` Ray cluster.\n4. If the issue still persists, you can try increasing the size of the Ray pods or adding more nodes to the Ray cluster. This can help ensure that there are enough resources available to run the Ray workload.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to debug the issue of nodes being stuck in the \"pending\" state for a long time when starting a Ray cluster with `ray up`.",

Ray Dashboard: You can use the Ray Dashboard to get a high-level overview of your Ray cluster and Ray Serve application's states. The dashboard provides details such as the number of deployment replicas currently running, logs for your Serve controller, deployment replicas, and proxies, and the Ray nodes (i.e. machines) running in your Ray cluster.\n2. Ray logging: Ray Serve uses Python's standard logging module with a logger named \"ray.serve\". By default, logs are emitted from actors both to stderr and on disk on each node at /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/. This includes both system-level logs from the Serve controller and proxy as well as access logs and custom user logs produced from within deployment replicas.\n3. Post-mortem debugging: You can automatically drop into the debugger when an error occurs or an exception is thrown. To do this, install the required dependencies (pip install \"ray[serve]\" scikit-learn) and set the env var RAY_PDB=1. When the serve_debugging.py driver hits the breakpoint, it will tell you to run ray debug.\n4. Memray: If you notice a memory leak on a Serve actor, you can use memray to debug.

Define your cluster configuration in a YAML file. This file should include the IP addresses of the nodes, the number of workers, and any other relevant configuration options.\n2. Start the Ray cluster using the Ray cluster launcher. The launcher will use the configuration file to start the cluster on the specified nodes.\n\nFor example, you can use the following command to start a Ray cluster on multiple nodes:\n```\nray up -y config.yaml\n```\nThis command will start the Ray cluster using the configuration defined in the `config.yaml` file.\n\nOnce the cluster is started, you can use the Ray CLI tools to manage the cluster and execute commands on the nodes. For example, you can use the `ray exec` command to execute a command on the cluster:\n```\nray exec <cluster config file> \"ray status\"\n```\nThis command will execute the `ray status` command on the cluster defined in the `<cluster config file>`.\n\nNote that the Ray cluster launcher is only available in Ray version 1.5 and later.

The actor is created with 0 CPUs and only occupies 0 CPUs after creation. This is because the Ray actor is designed to be lightweight and does not require a lot of CPU resources.\n\nIn the context provided, the Ray actor is used for data processing and the data processing tasks are not CPU-intensive. Therefore, the actor does not require a lot of CPU resources to complete the tasks.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Ray actor is designed to be highly parallelizable, which means that it can take advantage of multiple CPU cores to complete tasks more quickly.

The object store memory is used when your application creates objects in the object store via `ray.put` and when it returns values from remote functions. The memory is reference counted and evicted when it falls out of scope. An object store server runs on each node, and by default, when starting an instance, Ray reserves 30% of available memory. The size of the object store can be controlled by `--object-store-memory`. The memory is allocated to `/dev/shm` (shared memory) for Linux, and for MacOS, Ray uses `/tmp` (disk), which can impact the performance compared to Linux. In Ray 1.3+, objects are spilled to disk if the object store fills up.",

Set the `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` environment variable to the IP address of the head node, followed by the port that Grafana is running on (e.g. `http://<head_node_ip>:3000`).\n3. Set the `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST` environment variable to the IP address of the head node, followed by the port that Prometheus is running on (e.g. `http://<head_node_ip>:9090`).\n\nFor example, if the IP address of the head node is `55.66.77.88` and Grafana is running on port `3000`, you would set `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` to `http://55.66.77.88:3000`. Similarly, if Prometheus is running on port `9090`, you would set `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST` to `http://55.66.77.88:9090`.\n\nNote that you may need to adjust these settings if you are using a non-default port for Grafana or Prometheus, or if you are running them on a different machine.",

Insufficient resources: If the cluster is not provisioned with enough resources, such as CPU or memory, tasks may be queued or delayed, leading to spikes in CPU utilization.\n2. Preprocessing compute time: If the preprocessing step of the tasks is computationally intensive, adding more CPU-only nodes can help parallelize the preprocessing and reduce CPU utilization.\n3. GPU utilization rate: If the GPU utilization rate is low, it may indicate that the tasks are not being parallelized effectively, leading to spikes in CPU utilization.\n4. Memory usage: If the memory usage of the cluster is high, it may cause the node to run low on memory, leading to spikes in CPU utilization as the node tries to free up memory.\n5. System overload: If the system is highly overloaded or stressed, it may cause the node to crash or shut down, leading to spikes in CPU utilization.\n6. Linux Out of Memory killer: If the Linux Out of Memory killer is triggered, it may kill processes with high memory usage, leading to spikes in CPU utilization.\n7. Ray Memory Monitor: If the Ray Memory Monitor is triggered, it may kill processes with high memory usage, leading to spikes in CPU utilization.",
