If there aren't enough available CPUs, it requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. The Ray autoscaler, which runs on the head node or as a sidecar container in the head pod if using Kubernetes, increases the number of worker nodes when the resource demands exceed the current capacity and removes idle worker nodes from the cluster. When scaling down, Ray Serve tries to terminate replica actors in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, and the Ray autoscaler removes those nodes.",

If available, you can profile Ray jobs by clicking on the \"Stack Trace\" or \"CPU Flame Graph\" actions. Refer to the Profiling section for more details.\n\n3. For Ray Jobs, worker logs are always captured in the Ray logging directory, while driver logs are only captured for Ray Jobs submitted via the Jobs API. You can find the captured driver logs using the Dashboard UI, CLI (using the `ray job logs` command), or the Python SDK (`JobSubmissionClient.get_logs()` or `JobSubmissionClient.tail_job_logs()`).\n\n4. Ray client logs can be found at `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs` on the head node.\n\n5. You can query the logs of the job using the command: `ray job logs raysubmit_seQk3L4nYWcUBwXD`.\n\n6. Additionally, you can check the status of the job using the command: `ray job status raysubmit_seQk3L4nYWcUBwXD`.\n\n7. If needed, you can request the job to be stopped using the command: `ray job stop raysubmit_seQk3L4nYWcUBwXD`.\n\n8. Log messages include various details such as logging level, timestamp, deployment name, replica tag, request ID, route, file name, and line number. You can find a copy of these logs at `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/`. You can parse these stored logs with a logging stack like ELK or Loki to search by deployment or replica.\n\n9. To follow the logs of a job, use the command: `ray job logs 'raysubmit_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' --address http://127.0.0.1:8265 --follow`.\n\nBy following these steps and analyzing the logs, you can quickly identify the root cause of a failed Ray job.",

The working directory should contain the necessary files, including `local_dev.py`, which will be uploaded to the cluster and imported by Ray Serve.

This means that operations immediately return a promise/future, which is an identifier of the operation's result. To get the actual results, the programmer needs to call ray.get() on the IDs of the results. Ray natively integrates with asyncio, allowing it to be used alongside popular async frameworks like aiohttp and aioredis. Ray also supports async actors, where async method definitions are automatically detected. However, running blocking ray.get or ray.wait inside async actor methods is not allowed, as it would block the execution of the event loop. Ray seeks to cancel associated asyncio.Tasks for async actor tasks, aligning with asyncio task cancellation standards.",

Instantiate the Trainer class with the necessary arguments, such as the model, training arguments, and datasets.\n4. Add the callback to the Trainer using the `add_callback` method.\n\nExample:\n```python\nfrom transformers import Trainer, TrainerCallback\n\nclass MyCallback(TrainerCallback):\n    def on_train_epoch_end(self, trainer, pl_module):\n        # Define the behavior of the callback\n        # Access trainer and pl_module to perform desired actions\n\n# Instantiate the Trainer\ntrainer = Trainer(\n    model=model,\n    args=training_args,\n    train_dataset=train_dataset,\n    eval_dataset=eval_dataset,\n)\n\n# Add the callback to the Trainer\ntrainer.add_callback(MyCallback())\n```\n\nNote: The specific implementation of the callback may vary depending on the desired functionality.",

Check the logs for any errors related to IP address mismatch or container connections.\n3. If the head node is overloaded with simultaneous connections, it can cause delays in starting worker nodes. Start the worker nodes more slowly to alleviate this issue.\n4. If there are no available CPUs in the Ray cluster, it could be due to resources being used by Actors or Tune trials. Consider reducing the number of actors or adding more nodes to the cluster.\n5. Use the `wait_for_nodes` function provided in the context to wait for all nodes to join the cluster.
