When using `map_batches()`, ensure that the batch size is small enough to avoid potential out-of-memory situations. You want to make sure no single item in your Ray Data is too large and that the output batch can fit into memory comfortably. To manage the data type conversions effectively during the `map_batches` process, ensure the output format from your function aligns with the set `batch_format`."

This autoscaling feature is managed by the Ray Serve Autoscaler, which is an application-level autoscaler placed on top of the Ray Autoscaler. This setup means that the Ray Serve Autoscaler commands Ray to start a certain number of replica actors as per the request demand. \n\nImportantly, this feature enables the application to efficiently cater to user traffic without squandering resources. Ray Serve Autoscaler, running on the head node or as a sidecar container in the head pod (in case of using Kubernetes), is specifically designed to accommodate resource demands that exceed the existing capacity. Along with this, Ray Serve also supports features like batching, model optimization techniques, and streaming responses to further improve the application's performance."

If you need the address of the ray cluster, it can be specified as an address that can be passed to ray.init(), such as a Ray Client address (ray://<head_node_host>:10001).\n\n2. You can find the address of a ray node in the dashboard server on the head node, which would look something like this: \u201chttp://<head-node-ip>:8265\u201d.\n\n3. You may use specific commands or scripts which retrieve addresses. An example command given is: `RAY_HEAD_ADDRESS=$(skein kv get --key=RAY_HEAD_ADDRESS current)` This command gets addresses it needs from the skein key-value store, such as the head node address.\n\n4. If you use a command to start your ray node, the IP address and port of the node is often specified in the command itself. For instance, in the command `ray_head_node_cmd = [sys.executable,\"-m\",\"ray.util.spark.start_ray_node\",f\"--temp-dir={ray_temp_dir}\",\"--block\",\"--head\",f\"--node-ip-address={ray_head_ip}\",f\"--port={ray_head_port}\",]`, the `node-ip-address` and `port` are specifications of the ray node's address.\n\nPlease note that \"xx.xx.xx.xx\" is a placeholder for the actual IP address.

Some tasks can take longer to compute than others, and in some cases, it might take more than 10 minutes if the tasks are significantly complex. Furthermore, if the tasks have variable durations or if they involve asynchronous requests, they can run slowly. It's also important to note that the speed of response may be impacted by the overall load on the system, the kind of resources currently in use, and the need to gather and process data from various sources before responding. For most efficient results, it could be useful to batch tasks together, as it may present speed-ups for tasks that take less than ten milliseconds.

        "answer": "AsyncIO does not directly support Ray's remote tasks. If you use AsyncIO's await to wait for a Ray future like `await x.remote()`, it will issue a warning if it's running inside an async context.\n\nHowever, there are several workarounds to this. You can wrap the async function with a wrapper to run the task synchronously. \n\nAnother method is to use `await asyncio.wait([some_task.remote()])` instead of `ray.wait(object_refs)`. This allows you to increase concurrency by using async APIs. \n\nLastly, the result of `handle.remote()` can be passed directly as an argument to other downstream handles, without having to await on it. \n\nHere is an example of how you can use `await some_task.remote()` and `await asyncio.wait([some_task.remote()])`:\n\n```\nimport ray\nimport asyncio\n\n@ray.remote\ndef some_task():\n  return 1\n\nasync def await_obj_ref():\n  await some_task.remote()\n  await asyncio.wait([some_task.remote()])\n\nasyncio.run(await_obj_ref())\n```\n\nIn the above code, the function `some_task` is defined with the `@ray.remote` decorator to run the task asynchronously. The function `await_obj_ref` awaits the result of `some_task` and also demonstrates how to use `asyncio.wait()` to wait for the task to complete. Finally, `asyncio.run(await_obj_ref())` is used to run the async function `await_obj_ref`."

In addition to that, you can also use Dask on Ray to scale analytics and scientific computing workloads. \n\nDask is a Python parallel computing library. It provides big data collections that mimic the APIs of familiar libraries such as NumPy and Pandas. This feature makes it relatively easy for Python users to adopt Dask. Usage of Dask on Ray takes advantage of Ray-specific features, allowing for a more seamless integration in analytics workloads. \n\nIn terms of performance, it's mentioned that there's a comparison between Ray Data and Apache Spark as well as SageMaker. However, the details are not provided in the context. It would be advisable to refer to the referenced comparison for more detailed information on how they perform relative to one another in specific use-cases. \n\nIn summary, each of these tools has its strengths and usage would depend on the specific requirements of the project.

        "answer": "The \"connection refused\" error when you do `ray debug` on remote ray cluster can happen due to several reasons. One possibility could be that the address of the Ray cluster is not correctly specified. Based on the Python code and additional context it appears you initialise ray with the address \"ray://123.45.67.89:10001\", make sure this is the right address of the head node in your cluster. \n\nAdditionally, you require a Redis IP address for enabling the fault tolerance of the Ray cluster. It's suggested to set your Redis IP address in the configuration correctly. \n\nMoreover, it's crucial to initiate proper procedures for setting up your cluster in order to work interactively on a remote cluster. For more details, consider checking the Ray Client in the official Ray documentation.\n\nFinally, it's noted you shouldn't pass the `allow_multiple` argument to `ray.init` function. This could also be the cause of the issue. \n\nPlease check these aspects and revise your setup accordingly."

This requires only a few changes to the code as facilitated by Ray AIR, after importing Ray Train and Ray AIR Session. Ray AIR's Trainers are integrated with popular machine learning frameworks to offer distributed model training. A Ray AIR Checkpoint is setup to transfer the workload from training. Ray Train, as a component of Ray AIR, takes on the task of implementing a TensorflowTrainer. This feature allows distributed training with Tensorflow without the need to create and handle workers manually. This is achieved through the creation of workers in a Ray cluster and setting up the TF_CONFIG environment variable. At the end of this process, results are reported back to Ray Train."

One main advantage is its ability to support multi-model composition using a programmable API where calls to different models are as simple as function calls. This feature can reduce complexity and improve efficiency in your machine learning pipeline. One potential issue with using standard containers is that they can be limiting and more difficult to work with, especially when it comes to calls to different models. These difficulties can be mitigated by using a service like Ray Serve, whose API is user-friendly and intuitive, and also provides comprehensive reference documentation for assistance."

        "answer": "As the \"EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B\" is a large model, it may not fit on GPUs with memory less than 16 GB. For the task in context, you might need a GPU with larger memory. However, if you do not have the required hardware, you could use the DeepSpeed library to optimize the training process.\n\nNote that the exact memory required for this model heavily depends on the batch size and sequence length (if applicable) and there's no one-size-fits-all solution. However, for reference, setting a memory around 100*1023*1025 should be a good starting point as suggested in the first piece of context, but remember to adjust as needed to avoid out-of-memory errors.\n\nThe context also suggests using a smaller batch size or setting a memory value less than the train batch size if you are still receiving out-of-memory errors.\n\nUltimately the memory size needed also depends on what other tasks are running on your GPU and how much memory they require. So, it is recommended to monitor the GPU utilization during the process and adjust accordingly as per requirements."

This is only applicable for Ray jobs submitted via the Jobs API. \n\n2. Search for `RAY_LOG(DEBUG)` lines in the collected logs. These lines can be particularly helpful in pinpointing issues in the source code.\n\n3. If you're redirected Ray logs to stderr, you can check the `raylet.err` file for additional logging information. You might see a line like 'logging.cc:270: Set ray log level from environment variable RAY_BACKEND_LOG_LEVEL to -1' at the beginning. \n\n4. Refer to the 'ray logs' documentation for further understanding of how to get logs based on filename (cluster) or resource identifiers (actor).\n\n5. Using the Dashboard UI can also be fruitful in discovering the root problem through a visual representation of the job's activities.\n\nThese steps should help you in identifying the source of failure for the job.

        "answer": "In order to debug the issue of your worker node dying when using TensorflowTrainer with around 1500 workers, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check the logs**: The logs you've provided suggest that there might be an issue of memory pressure (Out of Memory, OOM) on one of your nodes. This is indicated by '10 Workers (tasks / actors) killed due to memory pressure (OOM)'. \n   \n2. **Memory Management**: Tensorflow typically reserves all available GPU memory for itself which can often lead to OOM issues. You may need to adjust the memory parameters for Tensorflow and the size of your dataset to make it fit into your available memory. You can also check if there are other processes consuming significant memory resources.\n\n3. **Workers status**: Reviewing the status and health of the worker nodes can provide useful information. In the provided context, a worker node ('RayTrainWorker pid=1478, ip=10.0.62.120') was able to complete 8 epochs of training before the issue occurred. Compare the health, resources and logs of this worker node with the one receiving the SIGTERM signal.\n\n4. **Code Debugging**: Ensure that your code is not inadvertently causing the issue. For example, if your code has memory leaks, it could cause worker nodes to fail unexpectedly.\n\n5. **Check system resources**: Review system stats and the state of local filesystem, RAM, CPU and network to ensure that there's no resource constraint leading to the issue.\n\n6. **Profiling**: You may want to profile your application with a tool suitable for distributed systems to find the bottleneck that is causing the worker to fail.\n\nRemember, debugging distributed systems can be complex due to factors like concurrency, failed network requests, etc. Therefore, a systematic approach to debugging can help identify and resolve the issue."

        "answer": "The difference between a batch and a block in the context of Ray datasets lies in their use and functionality. A block, which is a processing unit of data, consists of a collection of rows or data that Ray Data partitions into a set of distributed data blocks. This partitioning allows Ray Data to perform operations in parallel and it's mainly an internal abstraction.\n\nOn the other hand, a batch is more user-facing and is used for training purposes. The batch size needs to be small enough so that it comfortably fits into memory, thus avoiding potential out-of-memory situations. So, in essence, a block is a set of data that is processed in parallel while a batch is a subset of the dataset used for training that must fit into memory."

The Ray Client port on the head node may not be reachable from your local machine. This might require opening that port by configuring security groups or other access controls or proxying from your local machine to the cluster.\n2. The firewall settings and network configuration could be blocking the connection. You might need to adjust these settings.\n3. The Ray cluster address that is printed out by the command needs to be accurately passed to \"ray start\" on other machines to start the worker nodes.\n4. The command \"ray up cluster.yaml\" along with \"ray attach cluster.yaml -p 10001\" should be accurately executed, ensuring that the listening port (10001) is appropriately forwarded. \n5. AWS credentials also need to be configured correctly before running the command to deploy the Ray cluster.\nIf all these factors are properly considered, it should resolve the issue with \"ray up\" not starting the worker nodes."

Closely examine your Source Code: Review the entire source code, especially the implementation part of the `RolloutWorker` and the `sample` API. Deadlocks often occur due to incorrectly managed threads and processes, hence look closely at the threading and multiprocess handling elements of the code.\n\n2. Tracebacks: When the deadlock occurs, look at any tracebacks or logs which might indicate the part of the code where the issue is originating. \n\n3. Fault Handling: Look at the fault handling mechanisms in the code. Make sure the `handle_remote_call_result_errors` function is working as expected. \n\n4. LearnerThread: Check the `LearnerThread` class for any issues in the thread handling, including potential deadlocks when accessing shared resources or potential race conditions.\n\n5. Prevent Overlapping Calls: Deadlocks can happen due to overlapping calls in asynchronous environments. Make sure you're not making calls to methods that can't handle simultaneous execution.\n\n6. Use Debugging Tools: If your code is complex and large, you can use debugging tools to step through the code and watch the execution process. \n\n7. Scale of Data Collection: Deadlocks can also occur due to heavy data collection processes running in parallel. Identify if the system is reaching its limit for data collection.\n\n8. Log Debugging Messages: Add more logs in the worker's methods to help identify where the issue is.\n\n9. @ray.remote Actors: Verify if there is an issue with how the `RolloutWorkers` are being used as `@ray.remote` actors.\n\n10. CPU/Memory limits: Check the resource usage (CPU/Memory/IO) during the deadlock, this can highlight if the issue is due to resource starvation.\n\nBy carefully combing through these different aspects of your implementation, you should be able to locate and resolve the source of the deadlocking issue.\n"

You can do this by using the `get_objects` method, which gets the values in the object store associated with the IDs. Here, `object_refs` is a list of the references you want to retrieve and `timeout` is an optional float value that specifies the amount of time to wait before giving up.\n\nTo call the `get_objects` method with a list of object refs, you may use the following code snippet:\n\n```python\ndef get_objects(self, object_refs: list, timeout: Optional[float] = None):\n    ...\nreturn object_refs[0]\n```\n\nIn the case where there is more than one object ref, you can retrieve them using:\n\n```python\nreturn object_refs\n```\n\nEssentially, object refs are like pointers or unique IDs that can refer to a remote object without seeing its value. They can also be created in different ways. The return type of the method is `ObjectRef` which is the object ref that the object was put under.\nIn case you need to return a specific type `R`, you may overload the `get` function like this:\n\n```python\n@overload\ndef get(object_refs: \"ObjectRef[R]\", *, timeout: Optional[float] = None) -> R:\n    ...\n```"

The first step is to import the necessary libraries, specifically the typing, numpy and ray libraries:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n```\n\n2. The 'zero-copy' can be used as a parameter while calling `map_batches()` or `.to_numpy_refs()` function. This setting can boost performance and reduce memory use, as the numpy array stored is read-only and all Ray workers on the same node can read the numpy array in the object store without copying (zero-copy reads). Here is an example:\n\n```python\nray.data.range(10, parallelism=2).to_numpy_refs(zero_copy_batch=True)\n```\n\n3. If your function 'fn' doesn't mutate its input, you can also set `zero_copy_batch=True` to improve performance and decrease memory utilization:\n\n```python\nzero_copy_batch=True\n```\n\n4. This provides zero-copy access to the underlying data. For accessing data, you can use `.to_arrow()` or `.get_internal_block_refs()` functions:\n\n```python\nds.to_arrow()\nds.get_internal_block_refs()\n```\n\n5. If the object is a numpy array or a collection of numpy arrays, the `get` call is zero-copy and returns arrays backed by shared object store memory. Otherwise, the object data is deserialized into a Python object.\n\nRemember, the numpy array object in the worker process holds a pointer to the relevant array held in shared memory."

For example, you can use `glob` or `os` to locate all saved checkpoints, and then parse the filenames to find the checkpoint with the highest accuracy:\n\n```python\nimport glob\nimport re\n\n# Get all checkpoint files\nckt_files = glob.glob(f\"{storage_path}/LightningTrainer_*/checkpoint_*\")\n\n# Extract accuracy from each filename\naccuracies = [float(re.search(\"checkpoint_(.*)\", f).group(1)) for f in ckt_files]\n\n# Find the filename with the highest accuracy\nbest_checkpoint_file = ckt_files[accuracies.index(max(accuracies))]\n```\n\nNote that the exact code may vary depending on the exact structure of your filenames and directories. This is just a general example."

This simplifies the process of calling upon the actor when needed.\n3. Flexibility: If it is not possible to pass the actor handle directly to the task that requires it, using a named actor is a practical alternative.\n4. Control over Actor Lifetimes: You can choose to detach an actor for it to be accessible as long as needed, or keep it attached to the original driver's lifetime by only specifying the name, which can provide better control over the lifecycle of actors based on the specific requirements of your operation.\n5. Individual Actor Identification: In a setting with multiple actors, having a unique name assigned to each actor facilitates easier identification and management of individual actors."

This mode ensures that the types of data flowing through the pipeline meets the expected types declared by you. \n\nTo switch between this strict mode and the legacy behavior, an environment variable named 'RAY_DATA_STRICT_MODE' is used. Setting this to '0' reverts to the legacy behavior, i.e., switching off the strict mode. Remember, you need to set this on all cluster processes for consistency.\n\nAs for the code changes, there will be none if you are manually switching the modes using the environment variable. But, you need to be more cautious about the data types you are using if you have set the strict_mode to '1' (activated) to avoid any type errors in your data pipeline. You can find additional guidance in the Ray Data documentation (https://docs.ray.io/en/master/data/faq.html#migrating-to-strict-mode) and adjust your data pipeline accordingly based on the strict_mode setting.\n\nFor instance, if the data column holds an 'image', the data type should be a numpy.ndarray with 3 dimensions and dtype=uint8 in strict mode."

The `max_failures` param specifies the maximum number of times the trial will be retried. Make sure that you're using a trainable that implements trial checkpointing.\n\nIf the Ray Tune run fails, you can inspect the error messages to identify and correct the problem.

The reason is that when the Supervisor or the driver dies, the Worker Actors are automatically terminated due to actor reference counting. This is designed for actor fault tolerance as it ensures that if the process that owns or created the actor fails, the actor also terminates. In other words, the actor fate-shares with its owner.

        "answer": "To resolve the error \"ValueError: The actor ImplicitFunc is too large\", here are some possible solutions:\n\n1. The most common reason for this error message is when the actor's definition captures a large object or array. You have to check whether any large objects or arrays are being captured within the scope of the actor's definition.\n\n2. Use `ray.put()` method to store the large objects in the Ray's object store. This is useful as it helps to reduce the size of the object that is being captured.\n\n3. The warning message suggests you have an actor pool of size 4 but you've configured a batch size of 720. Consider reducing the batch size to ensure full parallelization across your actor pool. It's suggested the batch size should not exceed 360 in your case.\n\n4. If you're working with a data loader and encountering a similar error, consider moving the data loader to inside the training function. This can often help in reducing the size of the actor.\n\nRemember, your aim is always to reduce the number of large objects that are being implicitly captured in scope during the execution of your actor's code.\n\nIt's also always good to validate your code to ensure there are no TypeErrors or instances of classes not behaving as they should. In the context provided, there's a warning about inheriting from an `ActorClass`, which should be addressed if it's part of the code throwing your `ValueError`."

For instance:\n\n   ```python\n   import ray\n\n   ray.init(\n       runtime_env={\n           \"pip\": [\n               \"datasets\",\n               \"evaluate\",\n               \"transformers>=4.26.0\",\n               \"torch>=1.12.0\",\n               \"pytorch_lightning>=2.0\",\n           ]\n       }\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. Use vanilla Keras for non-distributed training scenarios. If your dataset is relatively small and there are many trials (e.g., many hyperparameter configurations), you can use a Ray tune callback with Tensorflow/Keras to parallelize model training.\n\n3. Create an Iterator[ray.data.Dataset] abstraction to represent a stream of data for incremental training. This abstraction is useful for large models that don't fit in GPU memory. Implement a custom Ray Actor-based data preprocessor to preprocess your dataset which will allow for incrementally training a model using data parallel training.\n\n4. When working with custom Keras models in RLlib, you may have to customize model training and preprocessor code. Consider using resources such as the \"Getting Started with RLlib\" tutorial or the \"Deep reinforcement learning at Riot Games\" video for help.\n\n5. To run distributed training of a TensorFlow model with Ray, use the following example as a guide:\n\n   ```python\n   import argparse\n   from filelock import FileLock\n   import json\n   import os\n   \n   # Insert your TensorFlow model code here\n   ```\n   \n   This example showcases how to use TensorFlow with Ray. For further details about this, refer to the example shared on the TensorFlow website in the tutorial 'multi_worker_with_keras'.\n\nRemember that Ray can be used for parallelizing, distributing as well as managing your computation.

Install kubectl and Helm if you haven't done it yet; they are necessary tools for the installation process. \n\n2. Prepare a Kubernetes cluster to deploy the KubeRay operator. Once the cluster is prepared, you are ready to install the CRDs. \n\n3. In your command line, add the KubeRay Helm chart repository by using the command: `helm repo add kuberay https://ray-project.github.io/kuberay-helm/`\n\n4. Install the KubeRay operator along with the CRDs using the following command: `helm install kuberay-operator kuberay/kuberay-operator --version 0.6.0`\n\nRemember, to utilize KubeRay, CRDs are a necessary prerequisite. Additionally, you can deploy a sample RayCluster CustomResource from the KubeRay Helm chart repository after the installation. Use the command: `helm install raycluster kuberay/ray-cluster --version 0.6.0`, and then check it by running the command `kubectl get rayclusters`.\n\nCRDs are vital as they allow for the extension of Kubernetes API in KubeRay."

This is used in batch inference where the class instance is created and the `__call__` method is executed. This method takes a batch of data items rather than a single one. This approach allows reusing the same inferencing logic and is particularly useful in offline batch inference with large datasets. The `__call__` method aids in reducing the load time by caching the model loading in its constructor."

        "answer": "To do inference from a model trained by Ray Tune's fit() method, you first need to extract the best model from your training results. Here are the steps to do inference:\n\n1. After running the experiment using `tuner.fit()`, Ray Tune will provide you with a dictionary where the keys are the names of the trials (combinations of hyperparameters) and the values are the results, which include the trained models.\n\n2. Select the trial that produced the best results based on your metric of interest. You can do this by iterating over the results dictionary.\n\n3. Once you've selected the best trial, you can get the trained model by accessing it in the dictionary. \n\n4. With the trained model, you can now use its `predict()` or `transform()` method to do inference. Assume `input_data` is the data you want to do inference on, then the code would look something like this:\n\n   ```python\n   best_model = results[best_trial]['model']\n   predictions = best_model.predict(input_data)\n   ```\n\nNote: The exact way to access the trained model from the results could vary based on the APIs you are using in Ray. This is a general pseudo-code. Replace `best_trial`, `model`, `predict` with the actual keys and method you used in your training function.\n\nFor more detailed usage, please refer to the official [Ray Tune](https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tune.html) documentation."

This is done by implementing a method that accepts a batch of data as a dictionary containing numpy arrays, converts this data to PyTorch tensors, and then runs the model with these tensors in inference mode, generating predictions from the data batch. This way, the user does not have to interact directly with PyTorch or TensorFlow."

This helps in controlling the execution flow of asynchronous tasks.\n* 'Ray Client' is used to connect your application to a remote Ray cluster. It enables running Ray tasks or actors on a remote cluster as if they were running locally.\n* 'ray.kill' is a function that is used to cease the execution of a particular task or actor. Using this method is generally considered unsafe as it can lead to inconsistent application state if not handled properly.\n* 'RayServeSyncHandle' is a part of Ray's serving library - Ray Serve.

As an example, if you've specified 0.5 GPU for a trial, the trial makes use of only half the GPU's resources, allowing other trials to share the same GPU. However, exceeding the allocated portion could lead to issues with performance and memory, possibly causing the trial to fail or crash. It's crucial that when using fractional GPUs, the models are kept small enough to fit into the GPU memory portion that's been allocated."

        "answer": "To pickle a variable that has been defined in an actor's init method, you should use instance variables. For instance, if you have a variable defined as `global_var_actor` in the `Actor` class's `__init__` method, it can be pickled and accessed outside the class definition like so:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def __init__(self, global_var_actor):\n        self.global_var_actor = global_var_actor\n\n    def f(self):\n        return ray.get(self.global_var_actor.get_global_var.remote()) + 3\n```\n\nIn this instance, `global_var_actor` is serialized (or \"pickled\") so it can be communicated between different processes. It's worth noting, however, that you should use Ray's actor instance variables to hold the global state and pass the actor handle to places where the state needs to be modified or accessed. Using class variables to manage state between instances of the same class is not supported. \n\nImportantly, actor creation will be executed with `__init__` together, as mentioned in the provided context. If `__init__` does not exist, you will need to explicitly define it to avoid complications and additional checks:\n\n```python\nif not is_function_or_method(getattr(Class, \"__init__\", None)):\n        # Add __init__ if it does not exist.\n        # Assign an __init__ function will avoid many checks later on.\n        def __init__(self):\n            pass\n```\n\nRemember to call the actor using the `remote()` method for proper instantiation."

Next, create an ActorPool and add your actors to this pool:\n```python\npool = ActorPool([a1, a2])\n```\n\n3. If required, you may dynamically add or remove actors from the pool. For instance, to add Actor a2 to the pool, use the push method:\n```python\npool.push(a2)\n```\n\n4. If you need to re-distribute work among the actors (for instance, if the number of actors has changed), use a re-partition function:\n```python\nself._repartition_datasets_to_match_num_actors()\n```\n\n5. To execute the all_reduce operation, use the `allreduce` method from Torch library. Specify the tensor list that you want to reduce and the reduce operation that should be applied:\n```python\nopts.reduceOp = op\ng.allreduce(tensor_list, opts)\n```\n\n6. If you need custom reduction functionality, you may define a `reduce_fn`. This function consumes the results of the actors and reduces them into a single result.  This can be included as an optional parameter in the input to the operation.\n\nRemember that this is just a general guide and the actual implementation would depend on the specific use cases and how the class ActorPooling and Actor is defined."

Import the 'ray' module, and any other necessary modules:\n\n```python\nimport ray\nimport unittest\n```\n\n2. Define a function decorated with '@ray.remote' to create a remote task:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote\ndef f(a, b, c):\n    return a + b + c\n```\n\n3. Spawn the remote task and retrieve the result using 'ray.get()':\n\n```python\nobject_ref = f.remote(1, 2, 3)\nresult = ray.get(object_ref)\n```\n\n4. For the unit test, you will need to use an assertion to check the expected result. This could be something like:\n\n```python\nassert result == (1 + 2 + 3)\n```\n\n5. Remember to initialize the Ray environment with 'ray.init()':\n\n```python\nray.init()\n```\n\n6. Document your code as thoroughly as possible, especially public functions. This helps in code maintenance and usage by other developers.\n\nHere is a simple example of how a unit test might look:\n\n```python\nclass TestRay(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_remote_addition(self):\n        ray.init()\n\n        @ray.remote\n        def f(a, b, c):\n            return a + b + c\n\n        object_ref = f.remote(1, 2, 3)\n        result = ray.get(object_ref)\n        self.assertEqual(result, 1 + 2 + 3)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nYour unit test code should be placed in the corresponding file in the 'ray/python/ray/tests/' directory.\n\nBefore finalising your work, go over any feedback you get during the code review process and make necessary changes. \n\nAnd finally, check 'doc/README.md' for instructions on creating and modifying public documentation.\n\nRemember, the unit test is just for testing a single function or piece of code. Other types of tests may be required for larger pieces of functionality or integrated systems."

The set_verbosity() function controls the level of logging. If you set the verbosity to 0, as in set_verbosity(0), it will effectively silence the updates printed to the stout.\n\nWhen you're done, you can shut down Ray by interrupting the run command. This can be done by pressing Ctrl-C when in the command prompt running the script.\n\nPlease note that by doing this, the worker log redirection to the driver feature of Ray will also be affected. To redirect logs specifically, use the feature \"Redirecting Ray logs to stderr\". Keep in mind, logs redirected this way will appear on the stderr output instead of stdout. \n\nFor additional assistance, you can check the issue https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/36949 on the Ray project's GitHub page."

You can do this by running the following command in your command line:\n\n```bash\npip install \"ray[serve]\" requests torch diffusers==0.12.1 transformers\n```\n\n2. Import the necessary modules in your Python script:\n\n```python\nfrom ray import serve\n\n# Import other necessary modules like torch, diffusers, transformers\n```\n\n3. Configure the deployment with the Ray Serve API. This could be a function or a class that you want to deploy. This component is often referred to as a backend.\n\n```python\nclass StableDiffusionModel:\n    # ... your model definition and methods go here ...\n\n# Use Ray Serve Deployment API\n@serve.deployment(route_prefix=\"/diffusion\")\nclass StableDiffusionDeployment(StableDiffusionModel):\n    # ... define methods to handle requests here ...\n```\n   \n4. Now you can start the Ray Serve system and deploy your model. Make sure that Ray is initialized before you deployed the model.\n\n```python\n# Start ray and ray serve\nray.init()\nserve.start()\n\n# Deploy the model\nStableDiffusionDeployment.deploy()\n```\n   \n5. Now your model is deployed with Ray Serve and is ready to handle incoming requests.\n\nPlease ensure that the codes are suited to your requirements and adjust the codes appropriately. Also, it would be good to check the Ray Serve [documentation](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/index.html) for a comprehensive guide on deploying models with Ray Serve.\n"

Import the necessary modules: ray and others if required.\n\n2. Set the pip version in the RuntimeEnv to ensure the specified version of pip is used. This can be done by setting pip_version in the dictionary sent to RuntimeEnv.\n\n   Example:\n   ```python\n   RuntimeEnv(\n       pip={\"packages\": [\"tensorflow\", \"requests\"], \"pip_check\": False, \"pip_version\": \"==22.0.2;python_version=='3.8.11'\"}\n   )\n   ```\n3. If you need to install a newer version of a package that already exists in the environment, specify the package name followed by its version in the 'pip' list of the 'runtime_env' for the actor or task options.\n\n   Example:\n   ```python\n   requests_version.options(\n       name=\"26\",\n       ray_actor_options={\"runtime_env\": {\"pip\": [\"requests==2.26.0\"]}}\n   ).deploy()\n   ```\n\n   The code snippet above forcefully upgrades the 'requests' package to version 2.26.0.\n\n4. If you are working with a new virtual environment and you find that older versions of pip and wheel, you can upgrade them using this command:\n\n   ```python\n   python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel\n   ```\n\n5. The 'conda' and 'pip' keys of runtime_env cannot both be specified at the same time. If you encounter a ValueError because you tried to specify them together, omit one of them from your RuntimeEnv.\n\n   Example:\n   ```python\n   if self.get(\"conda\") and self.get(\"pip\"):\n       raise ValueError(\"The 'pip' field and 'conda' field of runtime_env cannot both be specified.\\nspecified pip field: {self['pip']}\")\n   ```"

Ray natively integrates with asyncio and can be used alongside async frameworks like aiohttp and aioredis. Ray enables arbitrary functions to be executed asynchronously on separate Python workers, called \"tasks\". Tasks can specify their resource requirements in terms of CPUs, GPUs, and custom resources. Additionally, async methods can be defined in Ray, which allows it to automatically detect whether an actor supports async calls.

It is best to use the __name__ attribute so the logger will be appropriately named after the module containing your actor. Finally, you call an appropriate logging method like info() on the logger and provide the message you want to log.\n\n```python\nimport logging\nimport ray\n\n# Define your actor\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def log(self, msg):\n        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n        logger.info(msg)\n```\n\nNow you can create an instance of your actor, and you can call your log method remotely by appending \".remote\" to your method call. You provide the message you want to log as an argument, and finally, you use ray.get() to execute the method. Example as follows.\n\n```python\nactor = Actor.remote()\nray.get(actor.log.remote(\"A log message for an actor.\"))\n```\n\nNote that Task and Actor logs are accessible from the Task and Actor table view. Click the \u201cLog\u201d button to see the stdout and stderr logs which contain the output emitted from tasks and actors. \n\nBe cautious of enabling actor task logging as it can be expensive.

The return value of `ActorClass.remote(...)` is an actor handle that can be used to call its methods.\n\nThis method forwards the arguments directly to the actor constructor. The object returned, 'actor_instance' in this case, is a handle used to interact with the actor.\n\nNote that this operation doesn't use traditional instantiation methods for classes (__init__ methods), rather it specifically requires calling the 'remote' function of the ActorClass."

This is commonly found in the directory '/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/dashboard.log'. It's also worth noting that for Ray to work effectively, the logger requires you to do a full installation via 'pip install \"ray[default]\"', as this supports more commands to access logs from Ray clusters. If you still can't see the 'log.info', you might be using the Ray client which lacks support for the new engine. Overall, checking the specifics of your Ray installation and configuration as well as the dashboard logs should help diagnose the issue with 'log.info'."

        "answer": "The statement \"Ray will *not* retry tasks upon exceptions thrown by application code\" means that the Ray framework, by default, does not automatically reattempt tasks that fail due to errors within the software application's own code. \n\nNormally, Ray does reattempt tasks if they fail due to system issues or predefined application-level failures. This includes errors such as faults in the system itself, network problems, or other unexpected issues. This default behaviour can be customized using the \"max_retries\" and \"retry_exceptions\" options in 'ray.remote()' and '.options()'. \n\nHowever, for exceptions caused by the application's code, which may represent problems in your program's logic itself or the handling of external systems, Ray does not automatically retry the tasks. This is important because some errors might recur if the task is retried without addressing the underlying problem in the code. Developers are expected to handle such application-level failures themselves, possibly by using Ray's error-catching mechanisms."

        "answer": "The GCS (Global Control Service) server is a centralized metadata server for a Ray cluster. It manages cluster-level metadata and provides various cluster-level operations including actor, placement groups, and node management. It runs on the Ray head node, also managing node membership and actor directory.\n\nThe reason your GCS server might be taking up a lot of memory on the head node is because Ray's head node runs more memory-demanding system components like GCS or the dashboard along with driver running from the head node by default. GCS server especially tends to use more memory as it's a centralized component that many other components in Ray communicate with. \n\nIn your specific case, your resources limit and requests are set to 2Gi of memory which may contribute to the high memory utilization. Also, if the head node has the same memory capacity as worker nodes, this could leading to higher memory usage. \n\nWhen faced with issues related to high memory utilization by GCS, it's recommended to adjust the max file descriptors limit per process using the ulimit command."

Once the cluster is healthy, it becomes active and the previous cluster is terminated. See if your cluster is stuck in the preparation stage.\n\n2. Check your connection: If a connection error is thrown, check your firewall settings and network configurations. Make sure the address you are using to connect to the Ray cluster is accessible.\n\n3. Consider the node you are running on: If your Ray cluster is already started, you shouldn't need to run anything on the worker nodes. Check if you're accidentally running commands on a worker node.\n\n4. Restart the cluster: Sometimes, a problem may be resolved by restarting the Ray cluster. You can use the command `ray up CLUSTER.YAML --restart-only` to restart the cluster without running installation commands.\n\nPlease remember, whether your cluster is local or remote may also affect the troubleshooting steps."

        "answer": "To get more detailed errors or logs from Ray Serve when an internal failure occurs, you can use the debugging mechanisms provided by Ray. The standard mechanism is catching exceptions, which are raised when tasks fail. If a task raises an uncaught exception, then calling `ray.get` on the object ID returned by the task or an actor will propagate the exception to the caller. \n\n1. Use the `ray.exceptions` like `RayActorError`, `RayError`, `RaySystemError`, `RayTaskError`, etc. These can give you a specific sense of what error is occurring.\n\n2. There's also a lower-level API available to inspect the status of all objects in the system, called the `global state API`.\n\n3. It is worth noting that when the error takes place outside of a task \u2014 say, due to node failures or network issues \u2014 Ray will return a generic internal service error. However, Ray Serve logs these kinds of errors too (but not the application-level errors). So consider checking the logs in your Ray clusters to gain more insights.\n\n4. For networking related issues, Raylet can be a good tool to diagnose and fix problems.\n\nIt is important to note that the primary source of failures in Ray is from the .remote() API, which is used for creating tasks and actors, and the `ray.get()` API, used for getting results. You may want to focus your debugging efforts around these areas."

        "answer": "To kill a \"detached\" Actor in Ray, you need to use the `ray.kill` function to manually terminate the actor. This is done as detached actors are not automatically disposed of by Ray, and you have to manually destroy them when they are no longer needed. After using the `ray.kill` function, the actor\u2019s name may then be reused. This command will forcefully kill an actor. Take note that if the actor is a detached actor, subsequent calls to get its handle via `ray.get_actor` will fail. Here is an example of how to use the `ray.kill` function:\n\n```python\nray.kill(actor)\n```\n\nThe optional `no_restart` parameter can also be used if you don't want the actor to restart after being killed.\n\n```python\nray.kill(actor, no_restart = True)\n```\n\nRemember to ensure the actor is not needed before killing as it will be permanently terminated."

        "answer": "The reason your Ray tuner is showing \"running\" but CPU usage is almost 0% could be attributed to several factors. Firstly, if you're using Ray Data with Ray Tune, you need to ensure there are enough free CPUs for Ray Data to run on. By default, Tune will try to fully utilize the cluster CPUs, which could potentially prevent Ray Data from scheduling tasks, reducing performance or causing workloads to hang. \n\nSecondly, take into account that a Ray task requires 1 CPU, but a Ray actor, once scheduled, occupies 0 CPU. This could explain the low CPU usage. The code snippets provided also indicate that the number of CPUs for running tasks or actors is set to 0 (`ray.remote(num_cpus=0)(run)` and `ray.remote(num_cpus=0)(TunerInternal)`), which means no additional CPUs are used for these tasks or actors.\n\nFinally, by default, Ray tasks use 1 CPU resource and Ray actors use 1 CPU for scheduling and 0 CPU for running. Therefore, even though the actors are running, they might not be using any CPU resources which could explain the low CPU usage."

Since Grafana and your Ray Cluster are both on the same Kubernetes cluster, `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` should be assigned the external URL of the Grafana ingress. The same applies to `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST`.\n\nConsidering that the IP of your head node changes every time you reconfigure your cluster, you may want to use Kubernetes services to expose Grafana and Prometheus. By doing this, you can assign the aforementioned environment variables to the service names, creating a stable reference that doesn't change when you reconfigure your cluster. \n\nFor example, if you create a service named `grafana-service`, you would set `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` as `http://grafana-service:<port>`. Similarly, if you have a `prometheus-service`, you would set `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST` as `http://prometheus-service:<port>`.\n\nRemember that these settings should be configured when you start the Ray Clusters. The configuration process may vary based on how you launch the Ray Clusters. Integrating Prometheus and Grafana is an optional step to improve the Ray Dashboard experience. \n\nOnce you have these environment variables properly set up, you should be able to see time-series metrics in your Ray Dashboard."

        "answer": "The GCS (Global Control Store) in KubeRay autoscaling for Kubernetes primarily determines which pod to kill based on usage and demand. It typically targets idle pods for removal to optimize resource utilization. When the Ray autoscaler decides to delete an idle pod, the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler can clean up the remaining idle Kubernetes node. This process is safer than Horizontal Pod Autoscaler's method, which can randomly downscale a pod, potentially causing issues for a Ray application. To further prevent unnecessary disruptions, it's recommended to configure your RayCluster to fit only one Ray pod per Kubernetes node. Also, if GCS fault tolerance is configured on your cluster, worker pods can continue serving traffic without restarting, even if the head pod crashes and recovers."

        "answer": "The given context indicates that the node where the task was running may have crashed unexpectedly due to several reasons. It may have been caused by the failure of the instance where the node was running. This could be due to internal complications or external interruptions, such as a manual interruption of the experiment or an all-encompassing network error.\n\nAnother possible cause could be the unexpected crash of Raylet due to reasons like Out Of Memory (OOM) or the preemption of the node. If application tasks or actors consume a large amount of heap space, they can push the node to run out of memory (OOM). This forces the operating system to start killing worker or Raylet processes, interrupting application operations. The context also referenced specific incidents where 1 and 10 workers were killed due to memory pressure (OOM), highlighting OOM as a significant risk.\n\nIn some cases, if OOM occurs on the head node, it could also stall system metrics, contributing to unexpected crashes. Official advice is to reduce the memory used by your application or to decrease the Ray object store size."

Verify if the head node is accessible: The error \"Unable to connect to GCS at...\" usually indicates that the head node is inaccessible at the given --address. You'd want to check if you can connect to it.\n\n2. Check other nodes: As the context describes, while the head node is recovering, Serve applications can still handle traffic via worker nodes but can't be updated or recover from other failures. Confirm that all other nodes, specifically worker nodes, are in good condition.\n\n3. GCS: The Global Control Service (GCS) handles the management of cluster-level metadata. Verify whether any operations related to actor, placement groups, or node management have been performed recently that may disrupt its functions.\n\n4. Health-check failures: If a health-check fails, the Serve controller logs the exception and restarts the unhealthy replica(s). Review these logs to gain insight into what may have caused the node to become unhealthy.\n\n5. 'UNHEALTHY' deployment status : The deployment might become 'UNHEALTHY' due to errors in the deployment\u2019s constructor, a crashed replica, or a general system/machine error. Investigate these areas to identify the possible root cause.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to have a backup plan and regularly backup data to ensure integrity and availability in case of failures."

        "answer": "To avoid objects getting spilled in Ray, you need to ensure that the object store capacity is not used up as objects are spilled to external storage once this happens. This can be achieved by managing your memory usage effectively. Here are potential steps:\n\n1. Increase the object store's size: If the memory capacity can be expanded, do so to accommodate more objects in the object store.\n2. Memory Management: Manage how objects are distributed and try to propagate fewer huge objects that take up significant space.\n3. Serialization: If the stored data can be serialized, this is another method to save memory space.\n4. If feasible, consider using high-performance storage like NVMe SSDs. The use of high-performance storage is crucial when object spilling is enabled as Ray will spill objects to the disk if necessary.\n\nKeep in mind that avoiding object spilling might be essential to keep the performance of your applications optimal, as spilling comes with a performance penalty due to writing data to disk. Be sure to check the documentation for the specific Ray version you're using for additional guidance on managing object spilling."

The variable `replica_handle` now holds the handle to the replica:\n```python\nimport ray\nreplica_handle = ray.get_actor(\"SERVE_REPLICA::SleepyPid#RlRptP\", namespace=\"serve\")\n```\n3. With the handle, you can now kill this specific replica using `ray.kill()` function:\n```python\nray.kill(replica_handle, no_restart=True)\n```\n4. You can then exit the python script:\n```python\nexit()\n```\nAlternatively, if the replica is from a Kubernetes Deployment, you can simulate replica failures by manually killing deployment replicas. Make sure to exec into a Ray pod before running these commands:\n```bash\n$ ray summary actors\n```\nYou can then scale your replicas down or up using the `serve.run()` function:\n```python\nserve.run(func.bind())\n\n# Scale up to 3 replicas.\nserve.run(func.options(num_replicas=3).bind())\n\n# Scale back down to 1 replica.\nserve.run(func.options(num_replicas=1).bind())\n```\nRemember, killing a replica or a deployment can impact your application's performance, it should be performed with caution and mostly for testing and debugging purposes."
