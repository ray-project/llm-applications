            "generated_answer": "  The query is asking for advice on how to handle data type conversions when using the `map_batches` method in Ray Data. The context provides information on how to configure batch formats and transform data in Ray Data.\n\nThe advice is to use the `batch_format` parameter in the `map_batches` method to specify the batch type. By default, Ray Data represents batches as dicts of NumPy ndarrays. To return a different format from the function, specify the `batch_format` parameter. For example, to return a pandas DataFrame, specify `batch_format=\"pandas\"`.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `map_batches` method with a function that takes a batch of data and returns a batch of data in the desired format. For example, to increase the brightness of an image, you can use the `map_batches` method with a function that takes a batch of images and returns a batch of images with increased brightness.\n\nIt's also important to note that the `map_batches` method is unvectorized and can be slow for large datasets. If you're using a vectorized transformation, consider using `map_batches` instead.",

            "generated_answer": "  In a Ray Serve application, autoscaling works by automatically increasing or decreasing the number of replicas based on the load of the application. The Ray Serve autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that sits on top of the Ray Autoscaler, which is a Ray cluster process that automatically scales the cluster up and down based on resource demand. The Ray Serve autoscaler asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand, and if the Ray Autoscaler determines there aren't enough available CPUs to place these actors, it responds by requesting more Ray nodes. The underlying cloud provider will then respond by adding more nodes.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas.

The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider.

The `ParameterServer` class initializes the model and optimizer, and defines methods to receive gradients and apply them to the model, as well as to send the updated model back to the workers.\n\nThe workers, on the other hand, will asynchronously compute the gradients given their current weights and send them to the parameter server as soon as they are ready. When the parameter server finishes applying the new gradient, it will send back a copy of the current weights to the worker.

            "generated_answer": "  The issue you're experiencing with the Ray rollout workers deadlocking is likely due to the fact that you're using the `get_global_worker` function from the `ray.rllib.evaluation.rollout_worker` module. This function is used to retrieve the global worker instance, but it's not intended to be used in the way you're using it.\n\nThe `get_global_worker` function is only intended to be used within the context of a Ray actor, and it's used to retrieve the global worker instance that's associated with the actor. When you call `get_global_worker` outside of an actor, it will return `None`, which is why you're seeing the error message you mentioned.\n\nTo fix the issue, you should use the `RolloutWorker` class directly, rather than trying to retrieve the global worker instance. Here's an example of how you can do this:\n```\nfrom ray.rllib.evaluation.rollout_worker import RolloutWorker\n\n# Create a RolloutWorker instance\nworker = RolloutWorker(\n    env_creator=lambda _: gym.make(\"CartPole-v1\"),\n    default_policy_class=PGTF1Policy,\n    config=AlgorithmConfig(),\n)\n\n# Use the RolloutWorker instance to sample from the environment\nprint(worker.sample())\n```\nThis code will create a `RolloutWorker` instance and use it to sample from the environment. The `sample` method will return a `SampleBatch` object, which you can use to retrieve the samples from the environment.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
            "reference_answer": "To debug why ray rollout workers are deadlocking when using the sample API in `ray/rllib/evaluation/rollout_worker.py`, you can try setting `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` if you encounter errors like `blas_thread_init: pthread_create: Resource temporarily unavailable` when using many workers. You can also check configured system limits with `ulimit -a` for other resource limit errors. For unexpected hangs or performance problems, you can use `ray stack` to dump the stack traces of all Ray workers on the current node, `ray timeline` to dump a timeline visualization of tasks to a file, and `ray memory` to list all object references in the cluster. If you are developing with TensorFlow, it is recommended to use `framework=tf2` and `eager_tracing=True` for maximum performance and support. For debugging purposes, you should use `framework=tf2` with `eager_tracing=False`. All `tf.Tensor` values will then be visible and printable when executing your code.",

This means you can use this field to dynamically adjust model weights and versions without restarting the cluster, adjust traffic splitting percentage for your model composition graph, configure any feature flag, A/B tests, and hyper-parameters for your deployments. To enable the user_config feature, you need to implement a reconfigure method that takes a JSON-serializable object (e.g., a Dictionary, List or String) as its only argument. If the user_config is set when the deployment is created (e.g., in the decorator or the Serve config file), this reconfigure method is called right after the deployment\u2019s __init__ method, and the user_config is passed in as an argument.

This is because each actor can handle one key at a time, and having multiple keys per actor can lead to inefficiencies and increased complexity.\n\nIn the context of the provided code, it is recommended to create a separate actor for each key, as each actor can handle one key at a time. This will allow for better parallelization and more efficient use of resources.\n\nIt is also important to note that the number of actors to use can depend on the specific use case and the resources available in the cluster. In general, it is recommended to start with a small number of actors and gradually increase the number as needed, rather than starting with a large number of actors and then scaling down. This can help to avoid overloading the system and ensure that the actors are able to handle the workload efficiently.",

The `max_failures` parameter specifies the maximum number of times a trial can fail before it is considered to have failed permanently. The `retry_delay` parameter specifies the amount of time to wait before retrying a trial that has failed. The `retry_on_error` parameter specifies whether to retry a trial if it fails with an error.\n\nBy using `FailureConfig`, you can make your Ray Tune trials more robust and resilient to failures, and ensure that your experiments are completed successfully even in the presence of errors or other issues.",

You can use `ray.data.map` to do this. Here's an example:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Create a dataset of images\nds = ray.data.read_images(\"s3://anonymous@air-example-data/digits\")\n\n# Apply a transformation to each image\ndef transform_image(image):\n    # Do something to the image, e.g. resize it\n    return image\n\n# Apply the transformation to the dataset\nds = ds.map(transform_image)\n\n# Print the transformed dataset\nprint(ds)\n```\nIn this example, we first create a dataset of images using `ray.data.read_images`. We then define a function `transform_image` that takes an image as input and applies a transformation to it. We then use `ray.data.map` to apply this function to each image in the dataset. Finally, we print the transformed dataset.\n\nNote that `ray.data.map` is a lazy operation, meaning that it doesn't actually apply the transformation to the data until it's needed.

            "question": "How to set memory limit for each trial in Ray Tuner?",
            "generated_answer": "  To set the memory limit for each trial in Ray Tuner, you can use the `tune.with_resources()` function to specify the resources allocated per trial. For example, to set the memory limit to 1 CPU, you can use the following code:\n```\ntrain_model = tune.with_resources(train_model, {\"cpu\": 1})\n```\nAlternatively, you can use the `TuneConfig` class to specify the resources allocated per trial. For example:\n```\nfrom ray.tune import TuneConfig\n\nconfig = TuneConfig(\n    # ...\n    num_samples=100,\n    max_concurrent_trials=10,\n    resources={\"cpu\": 1}\n)\n```\nNote that the `resources` parameter in `TuneConfig` is a dictionary that specifies the resources allocated per trial. In this example, we are setting the `cpu` resource to 1, which means that each trial will be allocated 1 CPU.\n\nYou can also use the `FailureConfig` class to configure failure handling of individual trials. For example:\n```\nfrom ray import train, tune\n\ntuner = tune.Tuner(\n    my_trainable,\n    run_config=train.RunConfig(\n        stop={\"training_iteration\": 10, \"mean_accuracy\": 0.8}\n    ),\n    failure_config=tune.FailureConfig(\n        max_failures=10,\n        failure_timeout=600\n    )\n)\nresult_grid = tuner.fit()\n```\nIn this example, we are setting the `max_failures` parameter to 10, which means that each trial will be allowed to fail at most 10 times. We are also setting the `failure_timeout` parameter to 600, which means that if a trial fails, it will be stopped after 600 seconds (10 minutes).\n\nYou can also use the `Repeater` class to repeat trials of the same parameters. For example:\n```\nfrom ray.tune.search import Repeater\n\nre_search_alg = Repeater(\n    search_alg=search_alg,\n    repeat=10\n)\n\ntuner = tune.Tuner(\n    my_trainable,\n    run_config=train.RunConfig(\n        stop={\"training_iteration\": 10, \"mean_accuracy\": 0.8}\n    ),\n    search_alg=re_search_alg\n)\nresult_grid = tuner.fit()\n```\nIn this example, we are using the `Repeater` class to repeat each trial 10 times. The `search_alg` parameter is set to the `re_search_alg` object, which is a `Repeater` object that repeats the same parameters 10 times. The `run_config` parameter is set to a `train.RunConfig` object that specifies the stopping criteria for each trial.",

            "generated_answer": "  \n\nThe query is asking how to use Ray to distribute training for a custom neural net written using Keras in Databricks. The context provides information on how to use Ray Train to set up multi-worker training with Keras.\n\nTo use Ray to distribute training for a custom neural net written using Keras in Databricks, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Install Ray Train and TensorFlow packages: `pip install -U \"ray[train]\" tensorflow`\n2. Set up your dataset and model.\n3. Parse the command line arguments.\n4. Initialize Ray.\n5. Set up Ray distributed actors.\n6. Use the `ray.train.torch.prepare_model` and `ray.train.torch.prepare_data_loader` utility functions to set up your model and data for distributed training.\n7. Define a training function that accepts a configuration dict that contains the hyperparameters.\n8. Use the Ray Train API to distribute the training across multiple workers.\n\nHere is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use Ray to distribute training for a custom neural net written using Keras in Databricks:\n```\nimport ray\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom ray.train import ScalingConfig\nfrom ray.train.torch import prepare_model, prepare_data_loader\n\n# Define the model and data loader\nmodel = tf.keras.models.Sequential([\n    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),\n    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')\n])\n\ntrain_dataset = ...\ntest_dataset = ...\n\n# Prepare the model and data loader for distributed training\nmodel = prepare_model(model)\ntrain_dataset = prepare_data_loader(train_dataset)\ntest_dataset = prepare_data_loader(test_dataset)\n\n# Define the training function\ndef train_func(config):\n    # Get the current worker's index\n    worker_index = config['worker_index']\n\n    # Get the current worker's dataset\n    dataset = train_dataset[worker_index]\n\n    # Train the model on the dataset\n    model.fit(dataset, epochs=config['epochs'], batch_size=config['batch_size'])\n\n    # Return the model's accuracy on the test dataset\n    return model.evaluate(test_dataset, verbose=0)\n\n# Set up the scaling configuration\nscaling_config = ScalingConfig(num_workers=4, use_gpu=True)\n\n# Train the model using Ray Train\ntrainer = RayTrainer(train_func, scaling_config=scaling_config)\nresults = trainer.fit()\n```\nThis code defines a custom neural net using TensorFlow and Keras, and then uses Ray Train to distribute the training across multiple workers. The `prepare_model` and `prepare_data_loader` functions are used to set up the model and data for distributed training, and the `train_func` function defines the training loop. The `RayTrainer` class is used to train the model using Ray Train.",

This function should include the strategy for distributed training (in this case, MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy is used), model compilation and fitting. \\n4. Define a function to initiate the training using TensorflowTrainer from Ray. This function should include the configuration for the training such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc. \\n5. Finally, use argparse to parse command line arguments and initiate Ray. Depending on the arguments, initiate the training function defined earlier.",

The context provides several examples of how to create and use actors in Ray, but it does not provide a specific example of how to pickle a variable defined in an actor's init method.\n\nTo pickle a variable defined in an actor's init method, you can use the `pickle` module in Python.

This means that if you have a reference to an object in the actor's init method, that object will not be pickled.\n\nAlso, pickling an actor will not pickle any of the actor's methods or attributes.

Here's an example of how to write a unit test for a Ray program:\n```\nimport unittest\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n\n    def test_ray_function(self):\n        # Test the Ray function\n        result = ray.get(do_work.remote(2))\n        self.assertEqual(result, 4)\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        ray.shutdown()\n```\nIn this example, we define a `RayTest` class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. We then define a `setUp` method that initializes the Ray context and a `test_ray_function` method that tests a Ray function. Finally, we define a `tearDown` method that shuts down the Ray context.\n\nTo run the unit test, you can use the `pytest` command:\n```\npytest ray_test.py\n```\nThis will run the `test_ray_function` method and check that the result is equal to 4.\n\nNote that this is just a simple example, and you may need to modify it to fit your specific use case. Additionally, you can use other testing frameworks such as `pytest` or `nose` to write and run your unit tests.",

You can start a new Ray cluster for each test in the setUp method and shut it down in the tearDown method. However, starting and stopping a Ray cluster can add significant latency. To reduce this, you can share the Ray cluster across tests by initializing it in the setUpClass method and shutting it down in the tearDownClass method.

            "question": "How does Ray work with async.io ?",
            "generated_answer": "  \n\nRay supports async.io by using the `asyncio` module in Python. To use async.io with Ray, you can define an actor with async methods using the `@ray.remote` decorator, and then use the `asyncio` module to perform asynchronous operations within the actor.\n\nFor example:\n```\nimport asyncio\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass AsyncActor:\n    async def run_concurrent(self):\n        print(\"started\")\n        await asyncio.sleep(2) # concurrent workload here\n        print(\"finished\")\n\nactor = AsyncActor.remote()\n\n# regular ray.get\nray.get([actor.run_concurrent.remote() for _ in range(4)])\n```\nThis will create an actor with an async method `run_concurrent` that can be called concurrently using the `asyncio` module. The `ray.get` method is used to wait for the results of the concurrent calls.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `ray.wait` method to wait for the results of the concurrent calls, which is a non-blocking operation.\n```\nimport asyncio\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass AsyncActor:\n    async def run_concurrent(self):\n        print(\"started\")\n        await asyncio.sleep(2) # concurrent workload here\n        print(\"finished\")\n\nactor = AsyncActor.remote()\n\n# async ray.get\nasync def async_get():\n    await actor.run_concurrent.remote()\n\nasyncio.run(async_get())\n```\nThis will create an actor with an async method `run_concurrent` that can be called concurrently using the `asyncio` module. The `asyncio.run` method is used to run the `async_get` function, which waits for the results of the concurrent calls using the `ray.wait` method.\n\nIt's important to note that the `ray.get` method is a blocking operation, while the `ray.wait` method is non-blocking. This means that the `ray.get` method will wait for the results of the concurrent calls to be available, while the `ray.wait` method will return immediately and allow the driver program to continue executing other tasks.",
            "reference_answer": "Ray integrates natively with asyncio and allows for concurrent code execution using async/await syntax. It supports async frameworks like aiohttp, aioredis, etc. Ray provides AsyncActor class for defining actors that can run concurrent tasks. ObjectRefs in Ray can be translated to asyncio.Futures or concurrent.futures.Future objects, allowing to await on ray futures in existing concurrent applications. Ray runs all of the methods inside a single python event loop. In async actors, only one task can be running at any point in time. The number of concurrent tasks running at once can be set using the max_concurrency flag.",

Here's an example:\n```\nimport ray\nimport logging\n\n@ray.remote\nclass MyActor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n    def foo(self):\n        self.logger.info(\"Hello from MyActor!\")\n```\nIn this example, we create a logger for the `MyActor` class and use it to log a message inside the `foo` method. The log message will be displayed in the Ray dashboard.\n\nYou can also customize the prefixes for Actor logs by defining the `__repr__` method for the Actor class. This will replace the Actor name with the Actor repr in the log messages.\n\nTo modify the Ray log directory, you can add a volume mount to the Ray container's configuration. This will mount the Ray log directory to a directory on the host machine.\n\nTo mount the Ray log directory, you can use the following command:\n```\ndocker run -v /tmp/ray:/ray/logs rayproject/ray:latest\n```\nThis will mount the `/tmp/ray` directory on the host machine to the `/ray/logs` directory in the Ray container.\n\nTo view the logs for an Actor, you can use the Actors view in the Ray dashboard. This will show you the logs for the Actor and which Job created the Actor.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.get_actor_logs` method to get the logs for an Actor. This method returns a list of log messages for the Actor.\n\nFor example:\n```\nimport ray\n\nray.init()\n\n@ray.remote\nclass MyActor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n    def foo(self):\n        self.logger.info(\"Hello from MyActor!\")\n\nactor = MyActor.remote()\nray.get_actor_logs(actor)\n```\nThis will return a list of log messages for the `MyActor` Actor.",

The context provides information about Ray and its usage, including the `@ray.remote` decorator for defining remote functions or actor classes, and the `ray.actor.ActorClass.options()` method for configuring actor instantiation parameters.\n\nTo push a custom module to Ray, you can use the `ray.util.ActorPool.push()` method, which pushes a new actor into the current list of idle actors. The example code shows how to use this method to push an actor into the pool.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `ray.remote()` decorator to define a remote function or actor class, and then use the `ray.get_actor()` method to get a handle to a named actor. You can then use the `ray.kill()` method to kill an actor forcefully.\n\nIt's important to note that the `ray.remote()` decorator is used to turn functions into tasks and classes into actors, and the `ray.put()` method is used to put values into Ray's object store. The `ray.get()` method is used to get values from the object store, and it returns the values you've put there or that were computed by a task or actor.",

For example:\n```\nray.autoscaler.sdk.request_resources(num_cpus=5, bundles=[{\"CPU\": 1, \"GPU\": 1}])\n```\nThis will request 5 CPUs and 1 GPU from the autoscaler.\n\nNote that the `ray up` command is only available in Ray 1.0 and later, and the `ray.autoscaler.sdk.request_resources` function is only available in Ray 1.1 and later.",

The cluster will immediately attempt to scale to accommodate the requested resources, bypassing normal upscaling speed constraints. You can specify the number of CPUs you want to be available using the num_cpus parameter, or you can specify a set of resource shapes using the bundles parameter. For example, to request 1000 CPUs, you would use the command request_resources(num_cpus=1000). To request 64 CPUs and also fit a 1-GPU/4-CPU task, you would use the command request_resources(num_cpus=64, bundles=[{'GPU': 1, 'CPU': 4}]).",

            "generated_answer": "  The GCS server is a centralized metadata server for a Ray cluster, running on the Ray head node. It manages node membership and actor directory. The GCS server is also known as the Global Control Store.\n\nThe GCS server takes up memory on the head node because it stores metadata about the cluster, such as the list of nodes and actors present in the cluster. The amount of memory used by the GCS server is typically small, but it can grow as the size of the cluster increases.\n\nTo make the GCS fault tolerant, HA Redis is required. When the GCS restarts, it loads all the data from the Redis instance and resumes regular functions. During the recovery period, the following functions are not available: actor creation, deletion, and reconstruction; placement group creation, deletion, and reconstruction; resource management.\n\nThe head node is a node that runs extra cluster-level processes like GCS and API server, in addition to those processes running on a worker node. The head node has extra stress due to additional system processes running on it like GCS. A good starting hardware specification for the head node is 8 CPUs and 32 GB memory. The actual hardware specification depends on the workload and the size of the cluster.\n\nIf the GCS server process has failed in the head Pod, please inspect the log directory /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/ in the head Pod for errors related to the GCS server.\n\nTo run memory profiling on Ray core components, you can use Jemalloc (github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc). Ray supports environment variables to override LD_PRELOAD on core components. You can find the component name from ray_constants.py. For example, if you\u2019d like to profile gcs_server, search PROCESS_TYPE_GCS_SERVER in ray_constants.py. You can see the value is gcs_server. Users are supposed to provide 3 env vars for memory profiling.\n\nRAY_JEMALLOC_LIB_PATH: The path to the jemalloc shared library so.\nRAY_JEMALLOC_CONF: The MALLOC_CONF of jemalloc (comma separated).",

            "generated_answer": "  To get more detailed errors or logs from Ray Serve, you can use the following methods:\n\n1. Use the `ray.exceptions` module to catch and handle specific types of errors. For example, you can use `ray.exceptions.ObjectReconstructionFailedLineageEvictedError` to catch errors related to object reconstruction.\n2. Use the `ray.get` API to get the result of a remote function or actor. If the remote function or actor fails, the `ray.get` API will raise an exception with more detailed information about the failure.\n3. Use the `ray.serve.get_logs` API to get the logs of a Ray Serve deployment. This can help you understand the behavior of the deployment and surface application-level details during runtime.\n4. Use the `ray.serve.get_status` API to get the status of a Ray Serve deployment. This can help you understand the current state of the deployment and identify any issues that may be causing failures.\n5. Use the `ray.serve.get_metrics` API to get the metrics of a Ray Serve deployment. This can help you understand the performance of the deployment and identify any issues that may be causing failures.\n6. Use the `ray.serve.get_errors` API to get the errors of a Ray Serve deployment. This can help you understand the errors that are occurring in the deployment and identify any issues that may be causing failures.\n7. Use the `ray.serve.get_warnings` API to get the warnings of a Ray Serve deployment. This can help you understand the warnings that are occurring in the deployment and identify any issues that may be causing failures.\n8. Use the `ray.serve.get_info` API to get the information of a Ray Serve deployment. This can help you understand the current state of the deployment and identify any issues that may be causing failures.\n\nBy using these methods, you can get more detailed errors or logs from Ray Serve and identify the root cause of any failures that may occur.",

            "question": "What are the reasons for a node to change it\u2019s status to dead?",
            "generated_answer": "  There are several reasons why a node may change its status to dead in a Ray cluster, including:\n\n1. Raylet failure: If a raylet process fails, the corresponding node will be marked as dead and is treated the same as node failure.\n2. Task was killed due to the node running low on memory.\n3. When a worker node fails, the actors running on it also fail. Serve detects that the actors have failed, and it attempts to respawn the actors on the remaining, healthy nodes. Meanwhile, KubeRay detects that the node itself has failed, so it attempts to restart the worker pod on another running node, and it also brings up a new healthy node to replace it.\n4. Configuring IAM Role and EC2 Instance Profile: By default, Ray nodes in a Ray AWS cluster have full EC2 and S3 permissions (i.e. arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2FullAccess and arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess). This is a good default for trying out Ray clusters but you may want to change the permissions Ray nodes have for various reasons (e.g. to reduce the permissions for security reasons).\n5. Minimum child weight: When a decision tree creates new leaves, it splits up the remaining data at one node into two groups. If there are only few samples in one of these groups, it often doesn\u2019t make sense to split it further. One of the reasons for this is that the model is harder to train when we have fewer samples.\n6. Rescheduling Bundles on a Dead Node: If nodes that contain some bundles of a placement group die, all the bundles are rescheduled on different nodes by GCS (i.e., we try reserving resources again). This means that the initial creation of placement group is \u201catomic\u201d, but once it is created, there could be partial placement groups.\n7. Head node failure: You can simulate a head node failure by either killing the head pod or the head node.\n8. PENDING: The placement group creation is pending scheduling. It could be because there\u2019s not enough resources, some of creation stage has failed (e.g., failed to commit placement gropus because the node is dead).\n9. CREATED: The placement group is created.\n10. REMOVED: The placement group is removed.\n11. RESCHEDULING: The placement group is rescheduling because some of bundles are dead because they were on dead nodes.\n12. NodeAffinitySchedulingStrategy: NodeAffinitySchedulingStrategy is a low-level strategy that allows a task or actor to be scheduled onto a particular node specified by its node id. The soft flag specifies whether the task or actor is allowed to run somewhere else if the specified node doesn\u2019t exist (e.g. if the node dies) or is infeasible because it does not have the resources required to run the task or actor. In these cases, if soft is True, the task or actor will be scheduled onto a different feasible node. Otherwise, the task or actor will fail with TaskUnschedulableError or ActorUnschedulableError. As long as the specified node is alive and feasible, the task or actor will only run there.\n13. Handling Failures and Node Preemption: If a node fails, the cluster will automatically reschedule the tasks and actors on the failed node to other available nodes.\n14. provider.cache_stopped_nodes: If enabled, nodes will be stopped when the cluster scales down. If disabled, nodes will be terminated instead. Stopped nodes launch faster than terminated nodes.",
            "reference_answer": "A node can change its status to dead due to a worker node failure, a head node failure, or a raylet failure. In the case of a worker node failure, all running tasks and actors will fail and all objects owned by worker processes of this node will be lost. If a head node fails, the entire Ray cluster fails. When a raylet process fails, the corresponding node will be marked as dead and is treated the same as node failure. Each raylet is associated with a unique id, so even if the raylet restarts on the same physical machine, it\u2019ll be treated as a new raylet/node to the Ray cluster.",

Network bandwidth: If the network bandwidth is insufficient, it may cause the CPU utilization to spike as nodes compete for available bandwidth.\n\nTo address these issues, it is important to monitor the resource utilization of the cluster and adjust the resource requirements of tasks and actors accordingly. Additionally, ensuring that the cluster has sufficient resources and that the autoscaler is configured correctly can help prevent spikes in CPU utilization.",
            "reference_answer": "Spikes in node CPU utilization can occur due to the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node.

Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones. Tasks or actors that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM.

Use NVMe SSDs or other high-performance storage: This will help reduce the performance overhead of object spilling.\n2. Increase the object store size: This will give you more space to store objects before they need to be spilled.\n3. Use a distributed object store: This will allow you to store objects across multiple nodes, reducing the likelihood of objects being spilled.\n4. Use a faster storage device: If you are using an HDD, consider using an SSD or other faster storage device.\n5. Adjust the object spilling threshold: You can adjust the threshold at which objects are spilled to external storage to avoid spilling objects that are not necessary.\n6. Use a different storage backend: If you are using the default local storage backend, consider using a different backend that is optimized for your use case.\n7. Use a larger buffer size: If you are using a buffer size that is too small, consider increasing it to reduce the number of IO requests during spilling.\n8. Use a different spilling algorithm: If you are using the default spilling algorithm, consider using a different algorithm that is optimized for your use case.\n9. Use a different storage format: If you are using a storage format that is not optimized for your use case, consider using a different format.\n10. Use a different Ray version: If you are using an older version of Ray, consider upgrading to a newer version that may have improved object spilling performance.",
            "reference_answer": "To avoid objects not getting spilled in Ray, you can configure the directory where objects are spilled to. You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open). It is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. Spilling to multiple remote storages is also supported.",

It allows you to turn your functions and classes into Ray tasks and actors, and work with Ray objects. You can run functions as remote tasks in the cluster by decorating your function with @ray.remote and calling the function with .remote(). Ray also provides actors to parallelize computation across multiple actor instances. When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance of that class in the cluster. This actor can then execute remote method calls and maintain its own internal state.
