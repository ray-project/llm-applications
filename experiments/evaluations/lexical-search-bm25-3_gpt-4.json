The context provides information on how to configure the batch size and the potential issues that can arise when using large batch sizes.\n\nThe advice is to make sure that no single item in the Ray Data is too large, and to always call `ds.map_batches()` with a batch size small enough such that the output batch can comfortably fit into memory. This can be achieved by specifying the `batch_size` parameter in the `map_batches` method. Additionally, the context suggests that using the `batch_format` parameter can help to avoid potential out-of-memory situations.",

            "generated_answer": "  In a Ray Serve application, autoscaling works by automatically increasing or decreasing the number of replicas based on the load of the application. The Ray autoscaler is a process that runs on the head node or as a sidecar container in the head pod if using Kubernetes. It reacts to task and actor resource requests, and not application metrics or physical resource utilization. The Ray Serve autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that sits on top of the Ray Autoscaler, which determines the number of replica actors based on the request demand. If the Ray Autoscaler determines there aren't enough available CPUs to place these actors, it responds by requesting more Ray nodes, which the underlying cloud provider will then add.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas. This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The parameters include min_replicas, initial_replicas, max_replicas, and target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it tries to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

The training proceeds by the means of PyTorch DDP.\n\nTo facilitate this, we only need a few changes to the code:\n\n* We import Ray Train and Ray AIR Session:\nimport ray.train as train\n\n* We create the model, metric, and tokenizer inside the trainer_init_per_worker function.\n\n* We use the Ray Train API to distribute the training data and model updates across the machines.\n\n* We use the Ray AIR API to save and retrieve model checkpoints.\n\n* We use the Ray Serve API to load the model for batch prediction.\n\nOverall, Ray AIR provides a simple and efficient way to distribute the training data and model updates across multiple machines, allowing you to scale your training to large datasets and powerful hardware.",

The size of the model's weights is approximately 1.5 TB.\n\nTherefore, the total memory needed for the model is:\n\nMemory needed = (6.6 billion) x (4 bytes) + (1.5 TB) = 27.6 TB\n\nThis is a very large model, and it may not be possible to fit it on smaller GPU types (<=16 GB GRAM). To deal with this issue, you can use DeepSpeed, a library to optimize the training process and to offload and partition optimizer and parameter states, reducing GRAM usage. Furthermore, DeepSpeed ZeRO Stage 3 can load large models without running out of memory.\n\nIn summary, to determine the size of memory needed for the model, you need to consider the number of parameters in the model, the size of each parameter, and the size of the model's weights.

The context provides several examples of how to create a Checkpoint from a model, including using the `from_model` method of the `Checkpoint` class in PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face.\n\nTo create a Checkpoint from the model in memory, you can use the `from_model` method of the `Checkpoint` class, passing in the model as an argument. For example, in PyTorch, you can create a Checkpoint from a model like this:\n```\ncheckpoint = Checkpoint.from_model(model)\n```\nIn TensorFlow, you can create a Checkpoint from a model like this:\n```\ncheckpoint = TensorflowCheckpoint.from_model(model)\n```\nIn Hugging Face, you can create a Checkpoint from a model like this:\n```\ncheckpoint = HuggingFaceCheckpoint.from_model(model)\n```\nIt's important to note that the `from_model` method only stores the model's weights and not the entire model object.

These options can include things like the number of replicas, the resources to be used, and any additional parameters that need to be passed to the training function.\n\nTo use user config in Ray Serve, you can set the `user_config` field in the deployment configuration. This field should be a dictionary that contains the configuration options you want to set.\n\nFor example, to set the number of replicas for a deployment, you can use the following configuration:\n```\ndeployments:\n  - name: MyDeployment\n    user_config:\n      num_replicas: 6\n```\nYou can also set other configuration options, such as the resources to be used, by adding them to the `user_config` dictionary.

You can use the user_config field to supply structured configuration for your deployment. You can pass arbitrary JSON serializable objects to the YAML configuration. Serve then applies it to all running and future deployment replicas. The application of user configuration does not restart the replica. This means you can use this field to dynamically adjust model weights and versions without restarting the cluster, adjust traffic splitting percentage for your model composition graph, configure any feature flag, A/B tests, and hyper-parameters for your deployments. To enable the user_config feature, you need to implement a reconfigure method that takes a JSON-serializable object (e.g., a Dictionary, List or String) as its only argument. If the user_config is set when the deployment is created (e.g., in the decorator or the Serve config file), this reconfigure method is called right after the deployment\u2019s __init__ method, and the user_config is passed in as an argument.

            "generated_answer": "  To utilize the \"zero-copy\" feature in Ray for numpy arrays, you can set the `zero_copy_batch` parameter to `True` in the `map_batches` function. This will allow the function to read the numpy array in the object store without copying it, which can improve performance and decrease memory utilization.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `zero_copy_batch` parameter in Ray:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n\n# Create a Ray dataset from a numpy array\nds = ray.data.from_numpy(np.ones((1, 100)))\n\n# Define a function to preprocess the data\ndef preprocess_image(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    # Load a dummy neural network\n    model = nn.Sequential(\n        nn.Linear(in_features=100, out_features=1),\n        nn.Sigmoid(),\n    )\n    model.eval()\n\n    # Preprocess the image\n    transformed_image = model(batch[\"image\"])\n\n    # Return the preprocessed image\n    return {\"image\": transformed_image}\n\n# Map the preprocessing function over the dataset\nds = ds.map_batches(preprocess_image, zero_copy_batch=True)\n```\nIn this example, the `preprocess_image` function takes a batch of images as input, preprocesses them using a neural network, and returns the preprocessed images as a new batch. The `zero_copy_batch` parameter is set to `True` to allow the function to read the numpy array in the object store without copying it.\n\nNote that the `zero_copy_batch` parameter only works for numpy arrays and not for other types of data. Also, if the function mutates its input, you should set `zero_copy_batch` to `False` to avoid \"assignment destination is read-only\" or \"buffer source array is read-only\" errors.",

Detached actors do not have an owner process and are cleaned up when the Ray cluster is destroyed.\n* Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) is the asynchronous version of A2C, where gradients are computed on the workers directly after trajectory rollouts, and only then shipped to a central learner to accumulate these gradients on the central model. After the central model update, parameters are broadcast back to all workers.\n\nDisadvantages of using Singleton Actor:\n\n* Using class variables to manage state between instances of the same class is not supported.\n* If you don't need the stateful part of an actor, you're mostly better off using tasks.",

            "generated_answer": "  To make a Ray Tune trial retry on failures, you can use the `ray.train.FailureConfig` class to configure the experiment to stop on trial failures. With this configuration, if any trial encounters an error, the entire experiment will stop immediately.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `ray.train.FailureConfig` to stop the experiment on trial failures:\n```\nfrom ray import train, tune\nimport time\n\ndef my_failing_trainable(config):\n    if config[\"should_fail\"]:\n        raise RuntimeError(\"Failing (on purpose)!\")\n    # Do some training...\n    time.sleep(10)\n    train.report({\"mean_accuracy\": 0.9})\n\ntuner = tune.Tuner(\n    trainable=my_failing_trainable,\n    param_space={\"should_fail\": [True, False]},\n    run_config=train.RunConfig(\n        storage_path=os.path.expanduser(\"~/ray_results\"),\n        name=\"trial_fault_tolerance\",\n        failure_config=train.FailureConfig(max_failures=3),\n    ),\n)\ntuner.fit()\n```\nIn this example, the `FailureConfig` class is used to configure the experiment to stop on trial failures. The `max_failures` parameter is set to 3, which means that the experiment will stop after 3 failed trials.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.tune.Callback.on_trial_error` and `ray.tune.Callback.on_trial_recover` callbacks to handle trial failures and restarts. These callbacks are called when a trial fails or is recovered, respectively. You can use these callbacks to implement custom logic for handling trial failures and restarts.\n\nFor example, you can use the `on_trial_error` callback to log the error and stop the experiment, like this:\n```\nfrom ray import train, tune\nimport logging\n\ndef my_failing_trainable(config):\n    if config[\"should_fail\"]:\n        raise RuntimeError(\"Failing (on purpose)!\")\n    # Do some training...\n    time.sleep(10)\n    train.report({\"mean_accuracy\": 0.9})\n\ndef on_trial_error(iteration, trials, trial, **info):\n    logging.error(\"Trial %s failed with error: %s\", trial.trial_id, info[\"error\"])\n    train.stop()\n\ntuner = tune.Tuner(\n    trainable=my_failing_trainable,\n    param_space={\"should_fail\": [True, False]},\n    run_config=train.RunConfig(\n        storage_path=os.path.expanduser(\"~/ray_results\"),\n        name=\"trial_fault_tolerance\",\n        failure_config=train.FailureConfig(max_failures=3),\n    ),\n    callbacks=[on_trial_error],\n)\ntuner.fit()\n```\nIn this example, the `on_trial_error` callback is used to log the error and stop the experiment when a trial fails. The `callbacks` parameter is used to specify the callbacks to use for the experiment.",

This parameter specifies the maximum number of trials that can be run concurrently, and it can be used to limit the memory usage of each trial.\n\nFor example, if you want to limit the memory usage of each trial to 1 GB, you can set `max_concurrent_trials` to 10, which means that at most 10 trials can be run concurrently, and each trial will be limited to 1 GB of memory.\n\nHere's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to set the memory limit for each trial in Ray Tune:\n```python\nimport ray\nfrom ray import tune\n\n# Create a TuneConfig object with the desired parameters\nconfig = tune.TuneConfig(\n    # ...\n    max_concurrent_trials=10,  # Limit the number of concurrent trials to 10\n    # ...\n)\n\n# Create a Tune object with the TuneConfig object\ntune = ray.tune.Tune(config)\n\n# Run the Tune object with the desired parameters\ntune.run(\n    # ...\n    num_samples=100,  # Number of trials to run\n    # ...\n)\n```\nIn this example, the `max_concurrent_trials` parameter is set to 10, which means that at most 10 trials can be run concurrently. Each trial will be limited to 1 GB of memory, which is the default value for the `memory` parameter in the `TuneConfig` object.\n\nNote that the `max_concurrent_trials` parameter is optional, and you can omit it if you want to allow all trials to run concurrently. However, setting this parameter can help you control the memory usage of each trial and prevent the cluster from running out of memory.",

If you are using a `ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy`, you can try increasing the `max_tasks_in_flight_per_actor` parameter to allow more tasks to be queued for the actor. This can help to reduce the amount of time the actor spends waiting for tasks to complete.\n3. If you are using a `ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy`, you can try increasing the `max_size` parameter to allow more actors to be created. This can help to distribute the workload across more actors and reduce the amount of time the actor spends waiting for tasks to complete.\n4. If you are using a `ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy`, you can try reducing the `batch_size` parameter to reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed by each actor. This can help to reduce the amount of time the actor spends processing data.\n5. If you are using a `ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy`, you can try increasing the `num_cpus` parameter to allow more CPUs to be used by the actor. This can help to reduce the amount of time the actor spends processing data.\n6. If you are using a `ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy`, you can try increasing the `num_gpus` parameter to allow more GPUs to be used by the actor. This can help to reduce the amount of time the actor spends processing data.\n7. If you are using a `ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy`, you can try reducing the `max_retries` parameter to reduce the number of times the actor will retry a task if it fails. This can help to reduce the amount of time the actor spends retrying tasks.\n8. If you are using a `ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy`, you can try increasing the `retry_delay` parameter to increase the amount of time the actor will wait before retrying a task. This can help to reduce the amount of time the actor spends retrying tasks.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the `ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy` has a `max_size` parameter that can be used to limit the number of actors that can be created. If you are experiencing issues with the actor pool size, you may want to try reducing this parameter to limit the number of actors that can be created.",

The `setUp` method is called before each test function to initialize the Ray cluster.\n\nYou can also use the `pytest` framework to write unit tests for Ray code. Here's an example of how to write a unit test for a Ray program using `pytest`:\n```\nimport pytest\n\ndef test_ray_function():\n    # Test a Ray function\n    pass\n\ndef test_ray_actor():\n    # Test a Ray actor\n    pass\n```\nThis code defines two test functions `test_ray_function` and `test_ray_actor` that test a Ray function and a Ray actor, respectively.\n\nTo run the unit tests, you can use the `pytest` command in the terminal:\n```\npytest\n```\nThis will run all the unit tests in the current directory. You can also specify a specific test file to run by using the `-s` option:\n```\npytest -s test_ray.py\n```\nThis will run all the unit tests in the `test_ray.py` file.",

You can start a new Ray cluster for each test in the setUp method and shut it down in the tearDown method. However, starting and stopping a Ray cluster can add significant latency. To reduce this, you can share the Ray cluster across tests by initializing it in the setUpClass method and shutting it down in the tearDownClass method. Be aware that there are certain cases where it may be unsafe to reuse a Ray cluster across tests, such as if your application depends on setting environment variables per process or if your remote actor/task sets any sort of process-level global variables.",

In the `ray-cluster.yaml` file, you can set the `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` and `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST` variables.

            "generated_answer": "  The reasons for spikes in node CPU utilization in a Ray cluster include:\n\n1. Increased workload: When the cluster is handling a large workload, the CPU utilization may spike as the nodes work harder to process the tasks.\n2. Resource contention: If multiple tasks are competing for the same resources, the CPU utilization may spike as the nodes compete for access to those resources.\n3. Autoscaling: When the autoscaler is enabled, the cluster may scale up or down in response to changes in the workload, leading to spikes in CPU utilization.\n4. Task or actor resource requirements: If the tasks or actors in the cluster have resource requirements that are not met, the CPU utilization may spike as the nodes work harder to schedule and execute the tasks.\n5. Memory usage: If the memory usage on a node exceeds the threshold, Ray may kill the worker and the CPU utilization may spike as the node restarts the worker.\n6. Network speed: If the network speed is slow, the CPU utilization may spike as the nodes work harder to transfer data between each other.\n7. GPU usage: If the cluster is using GPUs, the CPU utilization may spike as the nodes work harder to manage the GPUs and schedule tasks.\n8. Disk usage: If the disk usage on a node is high, the CPU utilization may spike as the node works harder to manage the disk usage.\n\nTo address these issues, you can try the following:\n\n1. Optimize the workload to reduce the CPU utilization.\n2. Adjust the resource requirements for tasks and actors to reduce resource contention.\n3. Adjust the autoscaling configuration to avoid sudden changes in the number of nodes.\n4. Increase the memory usage threshold to avoid killing workers.\n5. Improve the network speed to reduce the CPU utilization.\n6. Optimize the GPU usage to reduce the CPU utilization.\n7. Increase the disk usage to reduce the CPU utilization.\n\nBy addressing these issues, you can reduce the spikes in node CPU utilization and improve the performance of your Ray cluster.",
            "reference_answer": "Spikes in node CPU utilization can occur due to the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node. By default, Ray tasks require 1 CPU each and Ray actors require 0 CPU each, so the scheduler limits task concurrency to the available CPUs and actor concurrency to infinite. Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones. Tasks or actors that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM. To manage this, the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node can be reduced by increasing the amount of resources requested by them.",

It provides a way to define a Ray job and its dependencies, such as the Ray cluster and the job's entrypoint, in a Kubernetes-native way.\n\nTo use RayJob, you can create a RayJob custom resource and submit it to the Kubernetes cluster using kubectl. The RayJob spec defines the Ray cluster and job, and the KubeRay operator will create the Ray cluster and submit the job to it.\n\nHere is an example of a RayJob custom resource:\n```\napiVersion: ray.io/v1\nkind: RayJob\nmetadata:\n  name: rayjob-sample\nspec:\n  rayCluster:\n    spec:\n      rayVersion: \"1.11.0\"\n      head:\n        spec:\n          containers:\n          - name: ray-head\n            image: rayproject/ray:1.11.0\n            command: [\"ray\", \"start\", \"--head\"]\n            ports:\n            - containerPort: 8265\n              name: dashboard\n      worker:\n        spec:\n          containers:\n          - name: ray-worker\n            image: rayproject/ray:1.11.0\n            command: [\"ray\", \"start\", \"--worker\"]\n            ports:\n            - containerPort: 8265\n              name: dashboard\n  job:\n    spec:\n      entrypoint: python /home/ray/samples/sample_code.py\n      shutdownAfterJobFinishes: false\n```\nThis RayJob custom resource defines a Ray cluster with a head node and a worker node, and a job that runs the Python script `sample_code.py` on the worker node. The `shutdownAfterJobFinishes` field is set to `false`, which means that the Ray cluster will not be deleted after the job finishes.",

You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open). It is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. Spilling to multiple remote storages is also supported.",

It allows you to turn your functions and classes into Ray tasks and actors, and work with Ray objects. You can run functions as remote tasks in the cluster by decorating your function with @ray.remote and calling the function with .remote(). Ray also provides actors to parallelize computation across multiple actor instances. When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance of that class in the cluster.
