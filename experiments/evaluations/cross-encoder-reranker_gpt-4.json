            "generated_answer": "  In a Ray Serve application, autoscaling works by automatically increasing or decreasing the number of replicas based on the load of the deployment. The Ray autoscaler is responsible for scaling up or down the number of worker nodes in the cluster based on the resource demands of the Ray workload. The Ray Serve autoscaler sits on top of the Ray Autoscaler and asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If the Ray Autoscaler determines there aren't enough available CPUs to place these actors, it responds by requesting more Ray nodes. The underlying cloud provider will then respond by adding more nodes.\n\nThe autoscaling algorithm takes into consideration several user-specified parameters, such as min_replicas, which is the minimum number of replicas for the deployment. The autoscaler also considers logical resource requests for scaling, such as those specified in @ray.remote and displayed in ray status, not physical machine utilization. If a user tries to launch an actor, task, or placement group but there are insufficient resources, the request will be queued. The autoscaler adds nodes to satisfy resource demands in this queue.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas. This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The parameters include min_replicas, initial_replicas, max_replicas, and target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it tries to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

For example:\n```\n@ray.remote(scheduling_strategy=\"SPREAD\")\ndef my_actor():\n    # Do some work\n    pass\n```\nThis will spread the actors across the cluster, so that each node has at least one actor running on it.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `ray.util.ActorPool` class to create a pool of actors that will be spread across the cluster. For example:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Create a pool of 10 actors\nactors = ray.util.ActorPool(10)\n\n# Spread the actors across the cluster\nactors.spread()\n```\nThis will create a pool of 10 actors and spread them across the cluster, so that each node has at least one actor running on it.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.nodes()` function to get a list of the nodes in the cluster, and then use the `ray.available_resources()` function to get the available resources on each node. This can help you determine how to spread the actors across the cluster.\n\nFor example:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Get a list of the nodes in the cluster\nnodes = ray.nodes()\n\n# Get the available resources on each node\navailable_resources = ray.available_resources()\n\n# Spread the actors across the cluster\nfor node in nodes:\n    # Get the available resources on this node\n    node_resources = available_resources[node]\n\n    # Spread the actors across the node\n    for i in range(node_resources[\"CPU\"]):\n        # Create an actor on this node\n        actor = my_actor.options(num_cpus=1).remote()\n\n        # Spread the actor across the node\n        actor.spread()\n```\nThis will create a pool of actors and spread them across the cluster, so that each node has at least one actor running on it.

The results will be collected from the distributed workers and passed to the driver to be logged and displayed.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use `train.report()` to log the results from multiple distributed workers into a single tensorboard:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.train import Trainer\n\n# Define your training function\ndef train_func():\n    # ...\n    # Report intermediate results and checkpoints\n    train.report(metrics={\"loss\": loss, \"accuracy\": accuracy})\n    # ...\n\n# Create a Trainer object\ntrainer = Trainer(backend=\"tensorflow\", num_workers=2)\n\n# Train the model\ntrainer.run(train_func)\n```\nIn this example, the `train_func()` function is executed on two workers, and the `train.report()` method is used to report the intermediate results and checkpoints from both workers to the Trainer. The Trainer then logs the results to a single tensorboard.\n\nNote that only the results from rank 0 worker will be used.

The `sync_frequency` is set to 10, which means that Ray AIR will sync the experiment results every 10 iterations. The `num_syncs_to_keep` is set to 5, which means that Ray AIR will keep the results of the last 5 syncs.\n\nYou can also use the `SyncConfig` object to configure other sync-related options, such as the `sync_timeout` and the `sync_retry_count`. For more information, see the Ray AIR documentation.",

            "generated_answer": "  The issue you're experiencing is likely due to a deadlock in the `ray.rllib.evaluation.rollout_worker.RolloutWorker` class. This class is used to perform rollouts in RLlib, and it appears that the `sample()` method is causing the deadlock.\n\nThe `sample()` method is used to collect samples from the environment, and it is called by the `learn_on_batch()` method. The `learn_on_batch()` method is used to train the policy on a batch of samples.\n\nThe deadlock is likely caused by a synchronization issue between the `sample()` method and the `learn_on_batch()` method. It's possible that the `sample()` method is waiting for the `learn_on_batch()` method to complete, while the `learn_on_batch()` method is waiting for the `sample()` method to complete.\n\nTo resolve the issue, you can try the following:\n\n1. Check the `ray.rllib.evaluation.rollout_worker.RolloutWorker` class to see if there are any synchronization issues between the `sample()` method and the `learn_on_batch()` method.\n2. Check the `ray.rllib.evaluation.sampler.SyncSampler` class to see if there are any issues with the synchronization of the `sample()` method.\n3. Check the `ray.rllib.evaluation.worker_set.WorkerSet` class to see if there are any issues with the synchronization of the `foreach_worker_async()` method.\n4. Check the `ray.rllib.algorithms.pg.pg_tf_policy.PGTF1Policy` class to see if there are any issues with the policy.\n5. Check the `ray.rllib.utils.from_config.AlgorithmConfig` class to see if there are any issues with the configuration.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, you can try using the `ray.rllib.utils.debugging.pdb` module to debug the issue. This module provides a debugger that can be used to step through the code and identify the source of the deadlock.",

You can also check configured system limits with `ulimit -a` for other resource limit errors. For unexpected hangs or performance problems, you can use `ray stack` to dump the stack traces of all Ray workers on the current node, `ray timeline` to dump a timeline visualization of tasks to a file, and `ray memory` to list all object references in the cluster. If you are developing with TensorFlow, it is recommended to use `framework=tf2` and `eager_tracing=True` for maximum performance and support. For debugging purposes, you should use `framework=tf2` with `eager_tracing=False`. All `tf.Tensor` values will then be visible and printable when executing your code.",

This configuration can include things like the number of replicas for a deployment, the resources to allocate to each replica, and any custom code or settings that the user wants to include in the deployment.\n\nTo use user config in Ray Serve, a user can define a configuration file in YAML format that specifies the desired configuration options for their deployments. This file can then be used with the `serve deploy` command to deploy the application to a Ray cluster.\n\nFor example, a user might create a configuration file called `fruit_config.yaml` that contains the following configuration options for a deployment:\n```\ndeployments:\n  - name: FruitStand\n    num_replicas: 2\n    ray_actor_options:\n      runtime_env:\n        pip:\n          packages:\n            - requests\n      num_gpus: 1\n      memory: 1024\n    user_config:\n      fruit_list: [\"APPLE\", \"BANANA\", \"ORANGE\"]\n```\nThis configuration file specifies that the `FruitStand` deployment should have two replicas, each with one GPU and 1024 MB of memory. It also specifies a custom `user_config` dictionary that contains a list of fruits to be served by the deployment.\n\nOnce the configuration file is created, the user can deploy the application to a Ray cluster using the `serve deploy` command, passing in the configuration file as an argument:\n```\n$ serve deploy fruit_config.yaml\n```\nThis will deploy the `FruitStand` deployment to the Ray cluster, with the specified configuration options. The user can then use the `serve config` command to view the current configuration of the deployment, or the `serve update` command to update the configuration of the deployment.",
            "reference_answer": "User config in Ray Serve is a configuration that you can pass to the reconfigure method of the deployment. This configuration can be updated dynamically without restarting the replicas of the deployment. The user_config must be fully JSON-serializable. You can use the user_config field to supply structured configuration for your deployment. You can pass arbitrary JSON serializable objects to the YAML configuration. Serve then applies it to all running and future deployment replicas. The application of user configuration does not restart the replica. This means you can use this field to dynamically adjust model weights and versions without restarting the cluster, adjust traffic splitting percentage for your model composition graph, configure any feature flag, A/B tests, and hyper-parameters for your deployments. To enable the user_config feature, you need to implement a reconfigure method that takes a JSON-serializable object (e.g., a Dictionary, List or String) as its only argument. If the user_config is set when the deployment is created (e.g., in the decorator or the Serve config file), this reconfigure method is called right after the deployment\u2019s __init__ method, and the user_config is passed in as an argument. You can also trigger the reconfigure method by updating your Serve config file with a new user_config and reapplying it to your Ray cluster.",

            "generated_answer": "  To utilize the \"zero-copy\" feature in Ray for numpy arrays, you can use the `zero_copy_batch` parameter in the `map_batches` method. This parameter allows you to specify whether the batches should be provided as zero-copy, read-only views on the data in the object store.\n\nHere's an example:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n\n# Create a dataset\nds = ray.data.from_items([\n    {\"name\": \"Luna\", \"age\": 4},\n    {\"name\": \"Rory\", \"age\": 14},\n    {\"name\": \"Scout\", \"age\": 9},\n])\n\n# Define a function to add dog years to the age column\ndef add_dog_years(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    batch[\"age_in_dog_years\"] = 7 * batch[\"age\"]\n    return batch\n\n# Map the function to the dataset using zero-copy batches\nds = ds.map_batches(add_dog_years, zero_copy_batch=True)\n\n# Show the resulting dataset\nds.show()\n```\nIn this example, the `add_dog_years` function takes a batch of data as input, adds a new column with the age in dog years, and returns the modified batch. The `zero_copy_batch` parameter is set to `True`, which means that the batches will be provided as zero-copy, read-only views on the data in the object store. This can improve performance and decrease memory utilization.\n\nNote that if the function mutates its input, you should set `zero_copy_batch` to `False` to avoid \"assignment destination is read-only\" or \"buffer source array is read-only\" errors.",

Unique name within the namespace: A named actor can be given a unique name within its namespace, which allows it to be retrieved from any job in the Ray cluster.\n2. Easy access: The actor can be easily accessed later somewhere in the code by using the `ray.get_actor()` method and passing the name of the actor as an argument.\n3. Garbage collection: The actor will still be garbage-collected if no handles to it exist, even if it has a name.\n4. Job-scope-unique name: In C++, named actors are job-scope-unique, meaning that the actor name is only valid within the job and cannot be accessed from another job.\n5. Get-or-create: The `get_if_exists` option for actor creation allows you to create an actor only if it doesn't exist, and if it does, a handle to the actor will be returned and the arguments will be ignored.",

This can be useful if you cannot directly pass the actor handle to the task that needs it, or if you are trying to access an actor launched by another driver. Named actors are also useful in scenarios where you want to create an actor only if it doesn't exist, as Ray provides a get_if_exists option for actor creation that does this out of the box.",

The GCS is a key-value store that runs on the head node of the cluster and stores metadata about the cluster and its resources. The GCS is used to store information about the jobs that have been run on the cluster, including the job ID, the job name, and the job status. The GCS is also used to store other metadata about the cluster, such as the list of nodes in the cluster and the resources available on each node.\n\nThe GCS is implemented as a Redis database, which is a popular open-source in-memory data store. The GCS uses the Redis database to store and retrieve data about the cluster and its resources. The GCS also uses Redis to implement a distributed locking mechanism, which allows the cluster to ensure that only one node can modify the GCS at a time.\n\nIn addition to the GCS, the Ray cluster also uses a separate Redis instance to store the state of the Ray actors. The actor state is stored in a Redis database that is separate from the GCS, and is used to store the state of the actors and their dependencies. The actor state is used to ensure that the actors can be restarted if they fail, and to ensure that the actors can be recreated if they are lost due to a failure.",

This method tells Ray Data to compute the entire preprocessed and pin it in the Ray object store memory. As a result, when iterating over the dataset repeatedly, the preprocessing operations do not need to be re-run. However, if the preprocessed data is too large to fit into Ray object store memory, this approach will greatly decreases performance as data needs to be spilled to and read back from disk.",

            "generated_answer": "  To write unit tests for Ray code, you can use the `ray.init()` function to start a new Ray cluster for each test. You can then use the `ray.remote` decorator to define remote functions and actors, and use the `ray.get()` function to retrieve the results of remote function calls.\n\nHere is an example of how you might write a unit test for a Ray application:\n```\nimport unittest\nimport ray\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n\n    def test_my_function(self):\n        @ray.remote\n        def my_function():\n            return 1\n\n        result = ray.get(my_function.remote())\n        self.assertEqual(result, 1)\n```\nThis test will start a new Ray cluster with 4 CPUs and 0 GPUs, and then define a remote function called `my_function` that returns the value 1. The test will then call the `my_function` remote function and retrieve the result using the `ray.get()` function. Finally, the test will assert that the result is equal to 1.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.cluster_utils.Cluster` class to create a mini-cluster with a specific number of nodes and resources, and then use the `ray.init()` function to connect to the cluster. This can be useful for testing your application in a distributed environment.\n\nFor example:\n```\nimport unittest\nimport ray\nfrom ray.cluster_utils import Cluster\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        cluster = Cluster(num_nodes=2, num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n        ray.init(address=cluster.address)\n\n    def test_my_function(self):\n        @ray.remote\n        def my_function():\n            return 1\n\n        result = ray.get(my_function.remote())\n        self.assertEqual(result, 1)\n```\nThis test will create a mini-cluster with 2 nodes, each with 4 CPUs and 0 GPUs, and then connect to the cluster using the `ray.init()` function. The rest of the test is the same as the previous example.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.",
            "reference_answer": "To write unit tests for Ray code, you can use the unittest module in Python. You can start a new Ray cluster for each test in the setUp method and shut it down in the tearDown method. However, starting and stopping a Ray cluster can add significant latency. To reduce this, you can share the Ray cluster across tests by initializing it in the setUpClass method and shutting it down in the tearDownClass method. Be aware that there are certain cases where it may be unsafe to reuse a Ray cluster across tests, such as if your application depends on setting environment variables per process or if your remote actor/task sets any sort of process-level global variables.",

To use async.io with Ray, you can define an actor as async and use the `async` keyword in the method definitions. You can also use the `asyncio.sleep` function to yield control from a long-running method call, allowing other method calls to run concurrently. Additionally, Ray provides a `concurrency_group` argument for actors to specify which methods should be executed concurrently.",

It supports async frameworks like aiohttp, aioredis, etc. Ray provides AsyncActor class for defining actors that can run concurrent tasks. ObjectRefs in Ray can be translated to asyncio.Futures or concurrent.futures.Future objects, allowing to await on ray futures in existing concurrent applications. Ray runs all of the methods inside a single python event loop. In async actors, only one task can be running at any point in time.

Reproduce the issue: Run the Python file that contains the `ray.get()` call, and call `ray debug` to start the debugger.\n2. Set a breakpoint: Press `0` to select the breakpoint, and then press `Enter` to set the breakpoint.\n3. Jump into the call: Use the `remote` command to jump into the call.\n4.

If the current node's object store does not contain the object, the object is downloaded.\n\nIt's important to note that calling `ray.get()` in a loop can harm performance, as it blocks the driver process until all results are available.

This function returns a list of `ray.util.state.common.ActorState` objects, each representing the state of an actor in the cluster.\n\nHere's an example of how to use this function:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.util.state import list_actors\n\n# List all actors in the cluster\nactors = list_actors()\n\n# List 50 actors from the cluster\nactors = list_actors(limit=50)\n\n# List actors with state PENDING\nactors = list_actors(filters=[(\"state\", \"=\", \"PENDING\")])\n```\nYou can also use the `ray.util.ActorPool` class to operate on a fixed pool of actors. This class provides a `get_next` method that returns the next pending result in order.\n\nHere's an example of how to use this class:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.util.ActorPool import ActorPool\n\n# Create a pool of actors\nactors = [Actor.remote() for _ in range(10)]\npool = ActorPool(actors)\n\n# Get the next pending result\nresult = pool.get_next()\n```\nYou can also use the `ray.util.state.summarize_actors` function to get a summary of the states of actors in the cluster. This function returns a dictionary with the following keys:\n\n* `alive`: The number of alive actors.\n* `dead`: The number of dead actors.\n* `pending`: The number of pending actors.\n* `running`: The number of running actors.\n* `success`: The number of successful actors.\n* `failure`: The number of failed actors.\n\nHere's an example of how to use this function:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.util.state import summarize_actors\n\n# Summarize all actors\nsummary = summarize_actors()\n```",

This method takes an actor as an argument and adds it to the pool of idle actors.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `ray.util.ActorPool.push()` to push a custom module to Ray that is used by an Actor:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.util.actor_pool import ActorPool\n\n# Define a custom module\nclass CustomModule:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.value = 0\n\n    def increment(self):\n        self.value += 1\n        return self.value\n\n# Create an ActorPool\npool = ActorPool([CustomModule()])\n\n# Push a new actor to the pool\npool.push(CustomModule())\n```\nIn this example, we define a custom module called `CustomModule` that has a `value` attribute and an `increment()` method. We then create an `ActorPool` with a single actor, and push a new actor to the pool using the `push()` method.\n\nNote that the `push()` method takes an actor as an argument, so you can push any actor that you have defined to the pool.",

            "generated_answer": "  The GCS (Global Control Service) server is a centralized metadata server for a Ray cluster. It runs on the head node and has functions like managing node membership and actor directory. The GCS server is responsible for storing and managing the metadata of the Ray cluster, such as the list of nodes, the list of actors, and the status of the tasks.\n\nThe GCS server is taking up a lot of memory on the head node because it needs to store all the metadata of the Ray cluster in memory. This is necessary for the GCS server to function properly and to provide fast access to the metadata.\n\nTo reduce the memory usage of the GCS server, you can try the following:\n\n1. Use a larger head node with more memory.\n2. Use a distributed database like HA Redis to store the metadata instead of storing it all in memory.\n3. Use a smaller Ray cluster with fewer nodes and actors.\n4. Use the --num-cpus=0 option to specify the number of CPUs to use for the GCS server. This can help reduce the memory usage of the GCS server.\n5. Use the --redis-shard-ports option to specify the ports for non-primary Redis shards. This can help reduce the memory usage of the GCS server.\n6. Use the --dashboard-grpc-port option to specify the gRPC port used by the dashboard. This can help reduce the memory usage of the GCS server.\n7. Use the --include-dashboard option to specify whether to include the dashboard in the GCS server.

This can help improve performance by reducing the amount of data movement required during shuffling.\n\nNote that local shuffling is not a true global shuffle, and it may not be suitable for all use cases.

The Kuberay operator logs contain information about the Serve application deployment event and Serve application health checks.\n\nAlternatively, you can check the controller log and deployment log, which are located under `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/` in both the head node pod and worker node pod. These logs contain information about specific deployment failure reasons and autoscaling events.\n\nYou can also use the Ray dashboard to get a high-level overview of your Ray cluster and Ray Serve application\u2019s states. The Ray dashboard provides details such as the number of deployment replicas currently running, logs for your Serve controller, deployment replicas, and proxies, and the Ray nodes (i.e. machines) running in your Ray cluster.\n\nTo understand system-level behavior and to surface application-level details during runtime, you can leverage Ray logging. Ray Serve uses Python\u2019s standard logging module with a logger named \"ray.serve\". By default, logs are emitted from actors both to stderr and on disk on each node at `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/`. This includes both system-level logs from the Serve controller and proxy as well as access logs and custom user logs produced from within deployment replicas.\n\nIn development, logs are streamed to the driver Ray program (the Python script that calls `serve.run()` or the serve run CLI command), so it\u2019s convenient to keep the driver running while debugging.",

You can do this by using the `Tuner.restore()` method and setting the `resume_errored` parameter to `True`.

It provides a set of core primitives, such as tasks, actors, and objects, for building and running distributed applications. Ray Core is the foundation that Ray AI libraries and third-party integrations are built on.",
            "reference_answer": "Ray Core provides a small number of core primitives for building and scaling distributed applications. It allows you to turn your functions and classes into Ray tasks and actors, and work with Ray objects. You can run functions as remote tasks in the cluster by decorating your function with @ray.remote and calling the function with .remote(). Ray also provides actors to parallelize computation across multiple actor instances. When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance of that class in the cluster. This actor can then execute remote method calls and maintain its own internal state. Ray stores task and actor call results in its distributed object store, returning object references that can be later retrieved.",
