            "generated_answer": "  The query is asking for advice on how to handle data type conversions when using the `map_batches` method in Ray Data. The context provides information on how to configure the batch format and how to transform batches with tasks.\n\nTo answer the query, I would suggest using the `batch_format` parameter in the `map_batches` method to specify the desired batch format. For example, to use NumPy arrays as the batch format, you can set `batch_format=\"numpy\"`. To use pandas DataFrames as the batch format, you can set `batch_format=\"pandas\"`.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the `transform_batch` method in the `Preprocessor` class to transform the data batches. This method takes a data batch as input and returns the transformed data batch. You can use this method to perform tasks such as data cleaning, feature scaling, and data transformation.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `transform_batch` method to transform a data batch:\n```\nfrom typing import Dict\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n\n# Compute a \"petal area\" attribute.\ndef transform_batch(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    vec_a = batch[\"petal length (cm)\"]\n    vec_b = batch[\"petal width (cm)\"]\n    batch[\"petal area (cm^2)\"] = vec_a * vec_b\n    return batch\n\n# Load the data.\nds = ray.data.read_images(\"s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/image-datasets/simple\")\n\n# Transform the data batches.\nds = ds.map_batches(transform_batch, batch_format=\"numpy\")\n```\nIn this example, the `transform_batch` function takes a data batch as input and computes a new attribute called \"petal area (cm^2)\" by multiplying the \"petal length (cm)\" and \"petal width (cm)\" attributes. The `map_batches` method is then used to apply the `transform_batch` function to each data batch in the dataset. The `batch_format` parameter is set to \"numpy\" to specify that the data batches should be represented as NumPy arrays.",
            "reference_answer": "You can specify the batch format in the map_batches() function. If you're working with NumPy ndarrays, your function should accept and return a dictionary of ndarrays. If you're working with pandas DataFrames, your function should accept and return a DataFrame.

            "generated_answer": "  In a Ray Serve application, autoscaling works by automatically increasing or decreasing the number of replicas based on the load. The Ray autoscaler is a process that runs on the head node and adjusts the number of nodes in the cluster based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups. When the resource demands of the Ray workload exceed the current capacity of the cluster, the autoscaler will try to increase the number of worker nodes. When worker nodes sit idle, the autoscaler will remove worker nodes from the cluster. Similarly, when Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it will try to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas. This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The parameters include min_replicas, initial_replicas, max_replicas, and target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider.

            "question": "how to scatter actors across the cluster?",
            "generated_answer": "  To scatter actors across the cluster, you can use the `scheduling_strategy` parameter in the `@ray.remote` decorator. For example:\n```\n@ray.remote(scheduling_strategy=\"SPREAD\")\ndef spread_func():\n    return 2\n\n# Spread tasks across the cluster.\n[spread_func.remote() for _ in range(10)]\n\n# Spread actors across the cluster.\nactors = [SpreadActor.options(scheduling_strategy=\"SPREAD\").remote() for _ in range(10)]\n```\nIn this example, the `SPREAD` strategy will try to spread the tasks or actors among available nodes.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `ScalingConfig` parameter in the `tune.Tuner` constructor to control the placement of actors. For example:\n```\ntuner = tune.Tuner(\n    tune.with_resources(\n        train_fn,\n        resources=ScalingConfig(\n            trainer_resources={\"CPU\": 2, \"GPU\": 0.5, \"hdd\": 80},\n            num_workers=2,\n            resources_per_worker={\"CPU\": 1},\n        ),\n    )\n)\ntuner.fit()\n```\nIn this example, the `ScalingConfig` parameter specifies the resources required for each worker, and the `num_workers` parameter specifies the number of workers to use. The `resources_per_worker` parameter specifies the resources required for each worker.\n\nYou can also use the `location` field of the `http_options` parameter in the `ray.serve.HTTPProxy` constructor to run a proxy on each node in the cluster. For example:\n```\nray.serve.HTTPProxy(\n    \"my_service\",\n    http_options={\n        \"location\": \"node1:8000\",\n        \"location\": \"node2:8000\",\n        \"location\": \"node3:8000\",\n    },\n)\n```\nIn this example, the `location` field specifies the node and port to use for each proxy.\n\nTo create an instance of the progress actor, simply call the `ActorClass.remote()` method with arguments to the constructor. This creates and runs the actor on a remote worker process. The return value of `ActorClass.remote(...)` is an actor handle that can be used to call its methods. For example:\n```\nprogress_actor = ProgressActor.remote(TOTAL_NUM_SAMPLES)\n```\nIn this example, the `ProgressActor` class is defined with a constructor that takes a single argument, `TOTAL_NUM_SAMPLES`. The `remote()` method is called on the `ProgressActor` class to create an instance of the actor, passing `TOTAL_NUM_SAMPLES` as an argument to the constructor. The return value of `remote()` is an actor handle that can be used to call methods on the actor.",

Here's an example of how to do this:\n```python\n# Create an instance of the parameter server\nps = ParameterServer.remote(1e-2)\n\n# Train the model in parallel\nfor epoch in range(num_epochs):\n    # Compute the gradients for each worker\n    gradients = []\n    for worker in workers:\n        gradients.append(worker.compute_gradients.remote(current_weights))\n\n    # Apply the gradients to the model using the parameter server\n    current_weights = ps.apply_gradients.remote(gradients)\n```\nIn this example, the `ParameterServer` instance `ps` is created and used to apply the gradients received from the workers using the `apply_gradients` method.

This means you can use this field to dynamically adjust model weights and versions without restarting the cluster, adjust traffic splitting percentage for your model composition graph, configure any feature flag, A/B tests, and hyper-parameters for your deployments. To enable the user_config feature, you need to implement a reconfigure method that takes a JSON-serializable object (e.g., a Dictionary, List or String) as its only argument. If the user_config is set when the deployment is created (e.g., in the decorator or the Serve config file), this reconfigure method is called right after the deployment\u2019s __init__ method, and the user_config is passed in as an argument. You can also trigger the reconfigure method by updating your Serve config file with a new user_config and reapplying it to your Ray cluster.",

Unique name: A named actor can be given a unique name within its namespace, which allows you to retrieve the actor from any job in the Ray cluster.\n2. Easy retrieval: You can retrieve the actor later somewhere in the code by using the `ray.get_actor()` method and passing in the name of the actor.\n3. Garbage collection: The actor will still be garbage-collected if no handles to it exist.\n4. Get-or-create: You can use the `get_if_exists` option to create an actor only if it doesn't exist, which is useful for creating an actor only if it doesn't exist.\n5. Non-global named actors: In C++, you can create non-global named actors that are only valid within the job and cannot be accessed from another job.\n6. Sync call: The `ray.get_actor()` method is a sync call and will timeout after 60s.\n7. Namespace: Named actors are scoped by namespace, and if no namespace is assigned, they will be placed in an anonymous namespace by default.\n8. Better off using tasks: If you don't need the stateful part of an actor, you're mostly better off using tasks.",
            "reference_answer": "Named actors in Ray allow you to give an actor a unique name within their namespace, which enables you to retrieve the actor from any job in the Ray cluster. This can be useful if you cannot directly pass the actor handle to the task that needs it, or if you are trying to access an actor launched by another driver. Named actors are also useful in scenarios where you want to create an actor only if it doesn't exist, as Ray provides a get_if_exists option for actor creation that does this out of the box.",

This can happen when the actor's constructor or the function it calls captures a large object in scope, causing the actor to become too large.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try the following:\n\n1. Use `ray.put()` to put large objects in the Ray object store, and then pass the object reference to the actor's constructor or function. This will allow the actor to fetch the object from the object store instead of capturing it in the actor's serialized state.\n2. If you are using a `ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy`, you can try increasing the `max_size` parameter to allow more actors to be created.\n3. If you are using a `ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy` and the actor's constructor or function is capturing a large object in scope, you can try moving the object creation outside of the actor's constructor or function, so that it is not captured in the actor's serialized state.\n4. If you are using a `ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy` and the actor's constructor or function is capturing a large object in scope, you can try using a `ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy` with a `max_size` parameter that is larger than the default value of 100. This will allow more actors to be created, which may help to reduce the size of the actor's serialized state.\n5. If you are using a `ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy` and the actor's constructor or function is capturing a large object in scope, you can try using a `ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy` with a `min_size` parameter that is smaller than the default value of 1. This will allow more actors to be created, which may help to reduce the size of the actor's serialized state.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the `ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy` is designed to be used with small actors, and it may not be the best choice for actors that have a large serialized size. In such cases, you may want to consider using a different compute strategy, such as `ray.data.LocalStrategy` or `ray.data.RemoteStrategy`.",

            "generated_answer": "  To write unit tests for Ray code, you can use the `unittest` module in Python. Here's an example of how to write a unit test for a Ray program:\n```\nimport unittest\nimport ray\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n\n    def test_ray_function(self):\n        # Test the Ray function here\n        pass\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        ray.shutdown()\n        assert not ray.is_initialized()\n```\nIn this example, we define a `RayTest` class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. We then define a `setUp` method that initializes the Ray cluster with 4 CPUs and 0 GPUs. We also define a `test_ray_function` method that tests the Ray function. Finally, we define a `tearDown` method that shuts down the Ray cluster and checks that it is no longer initialized.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.cluster_utils.Cluster` class to create a mini-cluster for testing. Here's an example of how to use this class:\n```\nimport unittest\nimport ray\nfrom ray.cluster_utils import Cluster\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        self.cluster = Cluster()\n        self.cluster.start()\n\n    def test_ray_function(self):\n        # Test the Ray function here\n        pass\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        self.cluster.shutdown()\n        assert not ray.is_initialized()\n```\nIn this example, we define a `RayTest` class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. We then define a `setUp` method that starts a mini-cluster using the `Cluster` class. We also define a `test_ray_function` method that tests the Ray function. Finally, we define a `tearDown` method that shuts down the mini-cluster and checks that it is no longer initialized.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.serve.handle` class to test Ray Serve deployments.

We then define a `setUp` method that creates a `RayServeHandle` object. We also define a `test_ray_serve_deployment` method that tests the Ray Serve deployment. Finally, we define a `tearDown` method that shuts down the `RayServeHandle` object and checks that it is no longer initialized.",

You can start a new Ray cluster for each test in the setUp method and shut it down in the tearDown method. However, starting and stopping a Ray cluster can add significant latency. To reduce this, you can share the Ray cluster across tests by initializing it in the setUpClass method and shutting it down in the tearDownClass method. Be aware that there are certain cases where it may be unsafe to reuse a Ray cluster across tests, such as if your application depends on setting environment variables per process or if your remote actor/task sets any sort of process-level global variables.",

You can also use the `filters` parameter to filter the actors based on certain criteria, such as their state or the class they belong to.\n\nFor example, to list only the actors that are currently running, you can use the following code:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# List all running actors in the cluster\nactors = ray.util.state.list_actors(filters=[(\"state\", \"RUNNING\")])\n\n# Print the actor IDs and class names\nfor actor in actors:\n    print(f\"{actor.actor_id} {actor.class_name}\")\n```\nThis will list only the actors that are currently running, along with their class names.

            "question": "I want to kill the replica actor from Python. how do I do it?",
            "generated_answer": "  To kill a replica actor from Python, you can use the `ray.kill` function and pass the actor handle as an argument. For example:\n```\nimport ray\n\nreplica_handle = ray.get_actor(\"SERVE_REPLICA::SleepyPid#RlRptP\", namespace=\"serve\")\nray.kill(replica_handle, no_restart=True)\n```\nThis will kill the replica actor forcefully, interrupting any running tasks and causing them to fail immediately. Any atexit handlers installed in the actor will not be run.\n\nIf you want to kill the actor but let pending tasks finish, you can call `actor.__ray_terminate__.remote()` instead to queue a termination task. Any atexit handlers installed in the actor will be run in this case.\n\nIf the actor is a detached actor, subsequent calls to get its handle via `ray.get_actor` will fail.\n\nNote that this method of termination waits until any previously submitted tasks finish executing and then exits the process gracefully with `sys.exit`. You could see the actor is dead as a result of the user\u2019s `exit_actor()` call:\n```\n# This API is only available when you download Ray via `pip install \"ray[default]\"`\nray list actors --detail\n```\nThis will list all actors in the current namespace, along with their details.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `ray.kill` function to manually terminate an actor forcefully, without waiting for pending tasks to finish. This should be reserved for cases where an actor is unexpectedly hanging or leaking resources, and for detached actors, which must be manually destroyed.\n\nFor example:\n```\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    pass\n\nactor_handle = Actor.remote()\n\nray.kill(actor_handle)\n```\nThis will kill the actor process and release resources associated/assigned to the actor.\n\nNote that this approach should generally not be necessary as actors are automatically garbage collected. The ObjectRef resulting from the task can be waited on to wait for the actor to exit (calling `ray.get()` on it will raise a `RayActorError`).\n\nIn some cases, you may need to manually terminate an actor from within one of the actor methods. This can be done by calling `ray.actor.exit_actor()`.\n\nFor example:\n```\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def exit(self):\n        ray.actor.exit_actor()\n\nactor = Actor.remote()\nactor.exit.remote()\n```\nThis will kill the actor process and release resources associated/assigned to the actor.\n\nNote that it does not need to be the original handle to the actor. You can also use `ray.kill` to manually terminate an actor from within another actor method.\n\nIf `max_restarts` is set, you can also allow Ray to automatically restart the actor by passing `no_restart=False` to `ray.kill`. For example:\n```\nimport ray\n\nproxy_handle = ray.get_actor(\"SERVE_CONTROLLER_ACTOR:SERVE_PROXY_ACTOR-91f9a685e662313a0075efcb7fd894249a5bdae7ee88837bea7985a0\", namespace=\"serve\")\nray.kill(proxy_handle, no_restart=False)\n```\nThis will kill the proxy actor forcefully, interrupting any running tasks and causing them to fail immediately. Any atexit handlers installed in the actor will not be run.\n\nIf you want to kill the actor but let pending tasks finish, you can call `actor.__ray_terminate__.remote()` instead to queue a termination task.

            "generated_answer": "  \n\nTo push a custom module to Ray that is using an Actor, you can use the `ray.remote` decorator to define the actor class and its methods. Then, you can use the `ray.get_actor` function to get a handle to the actor and call its methods.\n\nHere is an example:\n```\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass MyActor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.value = 0\n\n    def increment(self):\n        self.value += 1\n        return self.value\n\n    def get_counter(self):\n        return self.value\n\n# Create an actor\nmy_actor = MyActor.remote()\n\n# Call the actor's methods\nprint(ray.get(my_actor.increment.remote()))  # prints 1\nprint(ray.get(my_actor.get_counter.remote()))  # prints 1\n```\nIn this example, the `MyActor` class is defined with the `ray.remote` decorator, which indicates that it is an actor class. The `increment` and `get_counter` methods are defined as actor methods, which can be called on the actor using the `remote` method. The `ray.get` function is used to retrieve the result of the actor method calls.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.util.ActorPool` class to push a custom module to Ray that is using an Actor. The `ActorPool` class provides a way to manage a pool of actors and schedule tasks on them.\n\nHere is an example:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.util import ActorPool\n\n@ray.remote\nclass MyActor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.value = 0\n\n    def increment(self):\n        self.value += 1\n        return self.value\n\n    def get_counter(self):\n        return self.value\n\n# Create an actor pool\nactor_pool = ActorPool([MyActor.remote()])\n\n# Push a custom module to the actor pool\nactor_pool.push(MyActor.remote())\n\n# Call the actor's methods\nprint(ray.get(actor_pool.increment.remote()))  # prints 1\nprint(ray.get(actor_pool.get_counter.remote()))  # prints 1\n```\nIn this example, the `MyActor` class is defined with the `ray.remote` decorator, which indicates that it is an actor class. The `increment` and `get_counter` methods are defined as actor methods, which can be called on the actor using the `remote` method. The `ray.get` function is used to retrieve the result of the actor method calls.\n\nThe `ActorPool` class is used to create a pool of actors and schedule tasks on them. The `push` method is used to push a custom module to the actor pool, which can be used to schedule tasks on the actors in the pool.",

This can improve performance by reducing the amount of data movement required for shuffling.\n\nNote that the `local_shuffle_buffer_size` parameter only affects the shuffling of the data during the `map_batches()` operation. If you want to shuffle the data in a different way, you can use the `random_shuffle()` method or the `sort()` method, which both support the `local_shuffle_buffer_size` parameter.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the `local_shuffle_buffer_size` parameter only affects the performance of the shuffling operation, and it does not affect the overall performance of the `map_batches()` operation.

            "generated_answer": "  To get more detailed errors or logs from Ray Serve, you can use the following mechanisms:\n\n1. Catch application-level failures: Ray surfaces application-level failures as Python-level exceptions. When a task on a remote worker or actor fails due to a Python-level exception, Ray wraps the original exception in a RayTaskError and stores this as the task\u2019s return value. This wrapped exception will be thrown to any worker that tries to get the result, either by calling ray.get or if the worker is executing another task that depends on the object.\n2. Ray logging: Ray Serve uses Python\u2019s standard logging module with a logger named \"ray.serve\". By default, logs are emitted from actors both to stderr and on disk on each node at /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/. This includes both system-level logs from the Serve controller and proxy as well as access logs and custom user logs produced from within deployment replicas. In development, logs are streamed to the driver Ray program (the Python script that calls serve.run() or the serve run CLI command), so it\u2019s convenient to keep the driver running while debugging.\n3. Fault tolerance: Ray provides mechanisms to catch errors, retry failed code, and handle misbehaving code. See the pages for task and actor fault tolerance for more information on these mechanisms.\n4. Testing: We strongly recommend that you test your Ray Serve script locally or in a RayCluster before deploying it to a RayService. Please refer to rayserve-dev-doc.md for more details.\n5. Error handling: Ray APIs are future APIs (indeed, it is possible to convert Ray object references to standard Python future APIs), and the error handling model is the same. When any remote Tasks or Actors fail, the returned object ref contains an exception. When you call get API to the object ref, it raises an exception.",

The `g` function returns a `RaySystemError` exception, which is then caught and printed.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.exceptions.RayTaskError` class to catch and handle task-level exceptions in Ray Serve. This exception is raised when a task fails due to a Python-level exception.\n\nTo track the status of a Serve application, you can use the Ray dashboard. The dashboard provides a visual representation of the system state, allowing you to track the performance of applications and troubleshoot issues.

For example:\n```\nfrom ray.util.state import get_log\n\nget_log(node_id=<DEAD_NODE_ID>, filename='raylet.out')\n```\nThis will return the contents of the `raylet.out` log file on the dead node.\n\nNote that the `list_logs` and `get_log` APIs can also be used to get logs from other nodes in the cluster, not just dead nodes.",

You can collect logs written to a pod\u2019s filesystem using one of two logging strategies: sidecar containers or daemonsets. For sidecar containers, you can process logs by configuring a log-processing sidecar for each Ray pod. Ray containers should be configured to share the /tmp/ray directory with the logging sidecar via a volume mount. For daemonsets, you can collect logs at the Kubernetes node level by deploying a log-processing daemonset onto the Kubernetes cluster\u2019s nodes.

Insufficient resources: If the cluster is running low on resources, such as CPU or memory, it can lead to spikes in CPU utilization as nodes compete for available resources.\n2. Autoscaling: Ray's autoscaling feature can add or remove nodes from the cluster based on resource demands, which can lead to spikes in CPU utilization as new nodes are added or existing nodes are removed.\n3. Preprocessing compute time: If the preprocessing step of a task is computationally intensive, adding more CPU-only nodes can further parallelize preprocessing and lead to spikes in CPU utilization.\n4. Memory usage: If a node's memory usage exceeds a certain threshold, Ray may kill a worker and add a new node to the cluster, leading to spikes in CPU utilization.\n5. Head node stress: The head node in a Ray cluster is responsible for managing the cluster and can experience additional stress due to system processes running on it, leading to spikes in CPU utilization.",
            "reference_answer": "Spikes in node CPU utilization can occur due to the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node. By default, Ray tasks require 1 CPU each and Ray actors require 0 CPU each, so the scheduler limits task concurrency to the available CPUs and actor concurrency to infinite. Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones. Tasks or actors that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM. To manage this, the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node can be reduced by increasing the amount of resources requested by them.",

Use NVMe SSDs or other high-performance storage: This can help reduce the performance impact of object spilling.\n2. Increase the capacity of the object store: You can do this by increasing the memory available to the object store or by using a distributed object store.\n3. Configure object spilling to use multiple directories: This can help spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices, reducing the risk of running out of disk space.\n4. Adjust the local disk utilization threshold: You can adjust the threshold to a value that is appropriate for your use case, or set it to 1 to disable the protection.\n5. Use a faster disk: If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling.\n\nIt is important to note that object spilling can cause significant performance problems, so it is recommended to use these strategies only if necessary.",
            "reference_answer": "To avoid objects not getting spilled in Ray, you can configure the directory where objects are spilled to. You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open). It is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. Spilling to multiple remote storages is also supported.",

            "reference_answer": "Ray Core provides a small number of core primitives for building and scaling distributed applications. It allows you to turn your functions and classes into Ray tasks and actors, and work with Ray objects. You can run functions as remote tasks in the cluster by decorating your function with @ray.remote and calling the function with .remote(). Ray also provides actors to parallelize computation across multiple actor instances. When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance of that class in the cluster. This actor can then execute remote method calls and maintain its own internal state. Ray stores task and actor call results in its distributed object store, returning object references that can be later retrieved.",
