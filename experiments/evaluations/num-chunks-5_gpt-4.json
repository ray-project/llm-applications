The Ray autoscaler, which runs on the head node or as a sidecar container in the head pod in Kubernetes, increases the number of worker nodes when resource demands exceed the current capacity of the cluster. It removes idle worker nodes from the cluster. The autoscaler reacts to task and actor resource requests, not application metrics or physical resource utilization. Autoscaling can reduce workload costs but may have node launch overheads and can be tricky to configure.",

This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The parameters include min_replicas, initial_replicas, max_replicas, and target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it tries to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

It has several features and performance optimizations for serving Large Language Models such as response streaming, dynamic request batching, multi-node/multi-GPU serving, etc. Ray Serve is particularly well suited for model composition and many model serving, enabling you to build a complex inference service consisting of multiple ML models and business logic all in Python code. It is built on top of Ray, so it easily scales to many machines and offers flexible scheduling support such as fractional GPUs so you can share resources and serve many machine learning models at low cost.

            "generated_answer": "To debug why Ray rollout workers are deadlocking when using the sample API in `ray/rllib/evaluation/rollout_worker.py`, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Check if you have multiple workers running in parallel. Rollout workers are typically used as `@ray.remote` actors to collect and return samples from environments or offline files in parallel. Make sure you have the desired number of workers specified in your code.\n\n2. Look for any potential issues with the environment setup. Rollout workers advance and collect observations and rewards in an RL environment. Ensure that the environment creator and validation functions are properly defined and functioning as expected.\n\n3. Verify that the configuration settings are correct. The `config` parameter in the `RolloutWorker` initialization allows you to specify algorithm-specific configurations. Make sure these settings align with your desired behavior.\n\n4. Check for any errors or exceptions in the log files. If you have specified a log directory (`log_dir`), inspect the log files for any relevant error messages or stack traces that could indicate the cause of the deadlock.\n\nBy investigating these areas, you should be able to identify and resolve the deadlock issue with the Ray rollout workers.",
            "reference_answer": "To debug why ray rollout workers are deadlocking when using the sample API in `ray/rllib/evaluation/rollout_worker.py`, you can try setting `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` if you encounter errors like `blas_thread_init: pthread_create: Resource temporarily unavailable` when using many workers. You can also check configured system limits with `ulimit -a` for other resource limit errors. For unexpected hangs or performance problems, you can use `ray stack` to dump the stack traces of all Ray workers on the current node, `ray timeline` to dump a timeline visualization of tasks to a file, and `ray memory` to list all object references in the cluster. If you are developing with TensorFlow, it is recommended to use `framework=tf2` and `eager_tracing=True` for maximum performance and support. For debugging purposes, you should use `framework=tf2` with `eager_tracing=False`. All `tf.Tensor` values will then be visible and printable when executing your code.",

You can use the user_config field to supply structured configuration for your deployment. You can pass arbitrary JSON serializable objects to the YAML configuration. Serve then applies it to all running and future deployment replicas. The application of user configuration does not restart the replica. This means you can use this field to dynamically adjust model weights and versions without restarting the cluster, adjust traffic splitting percentage for your model composition graph, configure any feature flag, A/B tests, and hyper-parameters for your deployments. To enable the user_config feature, you need to implement a reconfigure method that takes a JSON-serializable object (e.g., a Dictionary, List or String) as its only argument. If the user_config is set when the deployment is created (e.g., in the decorator or the Serve config file), this reconfigure method is called right after the deployment\u2019s __init__ method, and the user_config is passed in as an argument.

You can specify the number of CPUs you want to be available using the num_cpus parameter, or you can specify a set of resource shapes using the bundles parameter. For example, to request 1000 CPUs, you would use the command request_resources(num_cpus=1000).

Check if the Kubernetes cluster has enough resources to accommodate the Ray application. Insufficient resources can cause the cluster to continuously restart, leading to a loop of restarts.\n\n2. Reproduce the situation by creating a Kubernetes cluster with an 8-CPUs node and using the provided YAML file (ray-service.insufficient-resources.yaml).\n\n3. Restart the Ray cluster without running any installation commands using the following command: `$ ray up CLUSTER.YAML --restart-only`.\n\n4. Wait for all nodes to start. This may take a few minutes, especially if the Ray images need to be downloaded. You can check the status of the pods using `kubectl describe pod raycluster-kuberay-xxxx-xxxxx` and ensure that your Docker resource limits are set high enough.\n\n5. If the pods are stuck in the Pending state, there may be errors. Check for errors using `kubectl describe pod raycluster-kuberay-xxxx-xxxxx`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and debug the issue with the pending nodes in your Ray cluster.",

Ray writes logs to files in the directory /tmp/ray/session_*/logs on each Ray pod\u2019s file system. You can collect logs written to a pod\u2019s filesystem using one of two logging strategies: sidecar containers or daemonsets. For sidecar containers, you can process logs by configuring a log-processing sidecar for each Ray pod. Ray containers should be configured to share the /tmp/ray directory with the logging sidecar via a volume mount. For daemonsets, you can collect logs at the Kubernetes node level by deploying a log-processing daemonset onto the Kubernetes cluster\u2019s nodes.

Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones.

You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open). It is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. Spilling to multiple remote storages is also supported.",

            "reference_answer": "Ray Core provides a small number of core primitives for building and scaling distributed applications. It allows you to turn your functions and classes into Ray tasks and actors, and work with Ray objects. You can run functions as remote tasks in the cluster by decorating your function with @ray.remote and calling the function with .remote(). Ray also provides actors to parallelize computation across multiple actor instances. When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance of that class in the cluster. This actor can then execute remote method calls and maintain its own internal state. Ray stores task and actor call results in its distributed object store, returning object references that can be later retrieved.",
