            "generated_answer": "  In a Ray Serve application, autoscaling works by automatically increasing or decreasing the number of replicas based on the load. The Ray autoscaler is a process that runs on the head node and adjusts the number of nodes in the cluster based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups. When the resource demands of the Ray workload exceed the current capacity of the cluster, the autoscaler will try to increase the number of worker nodes. When worker nodes sit idle, the autoscaler will remove worker nodes from the cluster. Similarly, when Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it will try to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas. This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The parameters include min_replicas, initial_replicas, max_replicas, and target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider.

For example:\n```\nfuture = x.remote()\nfut = asyncio.wrap_future(future)\nresult = await fut\n```\nIt is important to note that using `asyncio.wrap_future()` will not make the function that contains the `await` keyword asynchronous. The function will still block until the future is ready, and it will not be able to perform any other tasks in the meantime.

However, as a rough estimate, you may need at least 16GB of memory to run this example. This is because the `EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B` model is a large language model that requires a significant amount of memory to store and process.\n\nTo run this example, you will need to make sure that your Ray cluster has access to at least one GPU with 16 or more GBs of memory. You can do this by specifying the `num_gpus` and `memory` parameters when starting the Ray cluster. For example:\n```\nray start --head --num-gpus 1 --memory 16g\n```\nThis will start a Ray cluster with one GPU and 16GB of memory. You can then run the example code on this cluster.\n\nNote that the actual amount of memory needed may vary depending on the specific model and revision used.

This can happen when the worker node is not able to handle the workload assigned to it.\n\nTo debug this issue, you can try the following:\n\n1. Check the memory usage of the worker node using the `ray memory` command. This will give you an idea of how much memory is being used and how much is available.\n2. Check the logs of the worker node using the `ray logs` command. This will give you more information about the error and help you identify the cause.\n3. Try reducing the number of workers or the amount of data being processed by each worker. This can help reduce the memory usage and prevent the worker from running out of memory.\n4. If you're using a distributed database, make sure it's properly configured and can handle the amount of data being processed.\n5. If you're using a distributed file system, make sure it's properly configured and can handle the amount of data being processed.\n6.

You can also check configured system limits with `ulimit -a` for other resource limit errors. For unexpected hangs or performance problems, you can use `ray stack` to dump the stack traces of all Ray workers on the current node, `ray timeline` to dump a timeline visualization of tasks to a file, and `ray memory` to list all object references in the cluster. If you are developing with TensorFlow, it is recommended to use `framework=tf2` and `eager_tracing=True` for maximum performance and support. For debugging purposes, you should use `framework=tf2` with `eager_tracing=False`. All `tf.Tensor` values will then be visible and printable when executing your code.",

To enable the user_config feature, you need to implement a reconfigure method that takes a JSON-serializable object (e.g., a Dictionary, List or String) as its only argument. If the user_config is set when the deployment is created (e.g., in the decorator or the Serve config file), this reconfigure method is called right after the deployment\u2019s __init__ method, and the user_config is passed in as an argument. You can also trigger the reconfigure method by updating your Serve config file with a new user_config and reapplying it to your Ray cluster.",

The `batch_size` argument specifies the number of items in each batch.\n\nYou can also use a class-based UDF with `map_batches` to run the function as a long-running Ray actor. To do this, you can use the `compute` argument to specify `ActorPoolStrategy` with the number of parallel actors. For example:\n```\nclass MapFn:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Your code to initialize the actor\n        pass\n\n    def map(self, batch):\n        # Your code to process the batch\n        return [object1, object2, ...]\n\nds = ray.data.from_items([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nds = ds.map_batches(MapFn, batch_size=2, compute=ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy(num_actors=2))\n```\nIn this example, `MapFn` is a class that defines a `map` method that takes a batch of data and returns a list of objects.

            "question": "how do I make a Ray Tune trial retry on failures?",
            "generated_answer": "  To make a Ray Tune trial retry on failures, you can use the `FailureConfig` class in Ray Tune. This class allows you to configure the behavior of trials that fail during the experiment.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `FailureConfig` to make a trial retry on failure:\n```\nfrom ray import tune\n\n# Define the trial function\ndef train_model(config):\n    # Train the model\n    pass\n\n# Define the search space\ntrial_space = {\n    \"param1\": tune.choice([1, 2, 3]),\n    \"param2\": tune.choice([4, 5, 6])\n}\n\n# Define the failure configuration\nfailure_config = tune.FailureConfig(\n    max_failures=3,  # Maximum number of failures before the trial is stopped\n    failure_interval=60,  # Time interval between failures\n    failure_mode=\"retry\"  # Retry the trial on failure\n)\n\n# Start the Tune run\ntuner = tune.Tuner(train_model, param_space=trial_space, failure_config=failure_config)\nresults = tuner.fit()\n```\nIn this example, the `failure_config` parameter is passed to the `Tuner` constructor, which specifies the maximum number of failures (`max_failures`), the time interval between failures (`failure_interval`), and the failure mode (`failure_mode`). The `failure_mode` parameter can be set to \"retry\" to make the trial retry on failure, or \"stop\" to stop the trial on failure.\n\nYou can also use the `on_trial_error` and `on_trial_recover` callbacks in Ray Tune to handle trial failures and retries. These callbacks are called when a trial fails or is recovered, respectively. You can use these callbacks to perform custom actions, such as logging or sending notifications, when a trial fails or is recovered.\n\nFor example, you can use the `on_trial_error` callback to log the failure and the `on_trial_recover` callback to log the recovery:\n```\nfrom ray import tune\n\n# Define the trial function\ndef train_model(config):\n    # Train the model\n    pass\n\n# Define the search space\ntrial_space = {\n    \"param1\": tune.choice([1, 2, 3]),\n    \"param2\": tune.choice([4, 5, 6])\n}\n\n# Define the failure configuration\nfailure_config = tune.FailureConfig(\n    max_failures=3,  # Maximum number of failures before the trial is stopped\n    failure_interval=60,  # Time interval between failures\n    failure_mode=\"retry\"  # Retry the trial on failure\n)\n\n# Define the callbacks\ndef on_trial_error(iteration, trials, trial, **info):\n    print(f\"Trial {trial.trial_id} failed at iteration {iteration}\")\n\ndef on_trial_recover(iteration, trials, trial, **info):\n    print(f\"Trial {trial.trial_id} recovered at iteration {iteration}\")\n\n# Start the Tune run\ntuner = tune.Tuner(train_model, param_space=trial_space, failure_config=failure_config,\n                   on_trial_error=on_trial_error, on_trial_recover=on_trial_recover)\nresults = tuner.fit()\n```\nIn this example, the `on_trial_error` and `on_trial_recover` callbacks are defined and passed to the `Tuner` constructor. These callbacks are called when a trial fails or is recovered, respectively. The `on_trial_error` callback logs the failure, and the `on_trial_recover` callback logs the recovery.",

You can do this by adding the following line of code at the top of your script:\n```from pytorch_lightning.loggers.wandb import WandbLoggerCallback```\n\nOnce you have imported the WandbLoggerCallback, you can use it in your code to log metrics to Weights & Biases. Here is an example of how you can use the WandbLoggerCallback in your code:\n```\nfrom pytorch_lightning.loggers.wandb import WandbLoggerCallback\n\n# Initialize the WandbLoggerCallback\nwandb_logger = WandbLoggerCallback(\n    project=\"my_project\",\n    entity=\"my_entity\",\n    api_key=\"my_api_key\",\n    offline=False\n)\n\n# Use the WandbLoggerCallback to log metrics\nwandb_logger.log_metrics(\n    metrics={\"loss\": 0.5, \"accuracy\": 0.8},\n    step=1\n)\n```\nIn this example, we initialize the WandbLoggerCallback with the project, entity, and API key for our Weights & Biases account. We then use the log_metrics method to log the loss and accuracy metrics to Weights & Biases. The step parameter specifies the training step at which the metrics were logged.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

            "generated_answer": "  \n\nTo write unit tests for Ray code, you can use the `unittest` module in Python. Here's an example of how to write a unit test for a Ray program:\n```\nimport unittest\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n\n    def test_ray_function(self):\n        # Test the Ray function here\n        pass\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        ray.shutdown()\n        assert not ray.is_initialized()\n```\nIn this example, we define a `RayTest` class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. We then define a `setUp` method that initializes the Ray context and a `test_ray_function` method that tests the Ray function. Finally, we define a `tearDown` method that shuts down the Ray context and checks that it has been shut down.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.init` and `ray.shutdown` functions to start and stop the Ray cluster for each test. This can be useful if you want to ensure that each test runs in isolation and does not interfere with other tests.\n\nIt's also important to note that you can use the `ray.is_initialized` function to check if the Ray context has been initialized or not. This can be useful in your tests to ensure that the Ray context is properly initialized before running your tests.",
            "reference_answer": "To write unit tests for Ray code, you can use the unittest module in Python. You can start a new Ray cluster for each test in the setUp method and shut it down in the tearDown method. However, starting and stopping a Ray cluster can add significant latency. To reduce this, you can share the Ray cluster across tests by initializing it in the setUpClass method and shutting it down in the tearDownClass method. Be aware that there are certain cases where it may be unsafe to reuse a Ray cluster across tests, such as if your application depends on setting environment variables per process or if your remote actor/task sets any sort of process-level global variables.",

This will terminate the actor immediately, causing any current, pending, and future tasks to fail with a `RayActorError`. If you want to kill the actor but let pending tasks finish, you can call `actor.__ray_terminate__.remote()` instead to queue a termination task. Any atexit handlers installed in the actor will be run in this case.\n\nIt's important to note that calling `ray.kill` on a detached actor will not remove the actor's name, so you can still get the actor's handle via `ray.get_actor` after killing it. If you want to reuse the actor's name, you can call `ray.kill` with the `no_restart` flag set to `True`.\n\nHere's an example of how to kill a detached actor in Ray:\n```\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    pass\n\nactor = Actor.options(name=\"actor\", lifetime=\"detached\").remote()\n\n# Kill the actor\nray.kill(actor)\n```\nIn this example, we create a detached actor with the name \"actor\" and then kill it using `ray.kill`.

            "question": "How does Ray work with async.io ?",
            "generated_answer": "  \n\nRay supports async.io by using the `@ray.remote` decorator to turn functions into tasks and classes into actors. Ray also provides the `ray.get()` function to retrieve the results of remote operations. Additionally, Ray allows for pipelining, which can increase CPU utilization by preemptively requesting the next work item before processing the current one.\n\nTo use async.io with Ray, you can use the `asyncio` library to define asynchronous functions and methods, and then use the `@ray.remote` decorator to turn them into remote tasks or actors. You can also use the `ray.get()` function to retrieve the results of remote operations.\n\nHere is an example of how to use async.io with Ray:\n```\nimport asyncio\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass AsyncActor:\n    async def run_task(self):\n        print(\"started\")\n        await asyncio.sleep(2) # Network, I/O task here\n        print(\"ended\")\n\nactor = AsyncActor.remote()\n\n# regular ray.get\nray.get(actor.run_task.remote())\n```\nThis code defines an asynchronous actor with a single method, `run_task`, which performs a network or I/O task. The `ray.get()` function is used to retrieve the result of the remote operation.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.wait()` function to wait for the results of multiple remote operations. This can be useful for pipelining, which can increase CPU utilization by preemptively requesting the next work item before processing the current one.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `ray.wait()` for pipelining:\n```\nimport asyncio\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass AsyncActor:\n    async def run_task(self):\n        print(\"started\")\n        await asyncio.sleep(2) # Network, I/O task here\n        print(\"ended\")\n\nactor = AsyncActor.remote()\n\n# preemptively request the next work item\nnext_task = actor.run_task.remote()\n\n# wait for the current task to finish\nray.wait(next_task)\n\n# process the current task\nray.get(next_task)\n```\nThis code defines an asynchronous actor with a single method, `run_task`, which performs a network or I/O task. The `ray.wait()` function is used to wait for the result of the current remote operation, and the `ray.get()` function is used to retrieve the result. The `next_task` variable is used to preemptively request the next work item before processing the current one, which can increase CPU utilization.",
            "reference_answer": "Ray integrates natively with asyncio and allows for concurrent code execution using async/await syntax. It supports async frameworks like aiohttp, aioredis, etc. Ray provides AsyncActor class for defining actors that can run concurrent tasks. ObjectRefs in Ray can be translated to asyncio.Futures or concurrent.futures.Future objects, allowing to await on ray futures in existing concurrent applications. Ray runs all of the methods inside a single python event loop. In async actors, only one task can be running at any point in time. The number of concurrent tasks running at once can be set using the max_concurrency flag.",

The context provides an example of how to use the `RayTrainReportCallback` in the `Trainer` class.\n\nThe `RayTrainReportCallback` is a callback class that reports metrics and checkpoints to Ray Train. It overrides the `TrainerCallback.on_save()` method to report the latest metric dictionary from `TrainerState.log_history` and the latest checkpoint to Ray Train.\n\nTo use the `RayTrainReportCallback` in the `Trainer` class, you can add it as a callback in the `Trainer` constructor. For example:\n```\ntrainer = Trainer(\n    model=model,\n    args=training_args,\n    train_dataset=small_train_ds,\n    eval_dataset=small_eval_ds,\n    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,\n    callbacks=[RayTrainReportCallback()]\n)\n```\nYou can also implement your own customized report callback by inheriting from the `TrainerCallback` class and overriding the `on_save()` method.\n\nIt's important to note that the `RayTrainReportCallback` is only available in the `ray.train.lightning` module, so you need to make sure you have imported it correctly.",

In this class, you can define methods that correspond to different hooks in the training process, such as on_trial_result, on_trial_start, on_trial_error, etc. These methods will be called at the appropriate times during training. For example, the on_trial_result method will be called each time a result is received from a trial. In the provided example, a callback is created that prints a metric each time a result is received. This callback is then passed to the Tuner's run_config.",

This function takes two arguments: `num_cpus` and `bundles`. `num_cpus` specifies the number of CPUs to request, and `bundles` is a list of dictionaries that specify the resources to request.\n\nHere's an example of how to use this function to request additional resources:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Request 4 CPUs and 2 GPUs\nray.autoscaler.sdk.request_resources(num_cpus=4, bundles=[{\"GPU\": 2}])\n```\nThis will request 4 CPUs and 2 GPUs from the autoscaler. The autoscaler will then attempt to scale the cluster up to accommodate the requested resources.\n\nYou can also use the `ray up` command to scale up a cluster. This command takes a cluster configuration file as an argument, which specifies the desired cluster configuration.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `ray up` command to scale up a cluster:\n```\nray up my_cluster.yaml\n```\nThis will create or update a Ray cluster using the configuration specified in the `my_cluster.yaml` file. The `my_cluster.yaml` file should contain the desired cluster configuration, including the number of worker nodes and the resources to request.\n\nFor example, the following `my_cluster.yaml` file specifies a cluster with 4 worker nodes and 2 GPUs per worker node:\n```\ncluster:\n  name: my_cluster\n  worker_nodes:\n    - count: 4\n      resources:\n        GPU: 2\n```\nThis will create a cluster with 4 worker nodes, each with 2 GPUs.

You can specify the number of CPUs you want to be available using the num_cpus parameter, or you can specify a set of resource shapes using the bundles parameter. For example, to request 1000 CPUs, you would use the command request_resources(num_cpus=1000).

            "generated_answer": "  The GCS server is a centralized metadata server for a Ray cluster, running on the Ray head node. It manages node membership and actor directory, and is also known as the Global Control Store. The GCS server takes up memory on the head node because it stores metadata about the cluster, such as the list of nodes and actors present in the cluster.\n\nThe GCS server is not fault-tolerant by default, as all data is stored in-memory and its failure means that the entire Ray cluster fails. To make the GCS fault-tolerant, HA Redis is required, which loads all data from the Redis instance and resumes regular functions when the GCS restarts. During the recovery period, the following functions are not available: actor creation, deletion, and reconstruction; placement group creation, deletion, and reconstruction; resource management.\n\nThe head node has more memory-demanding system components such as GCS or the dashboard, and the driver runs from a head node by default. If the head node has the same memory capacity as worker nodes and if you execute the same number of Tasks and Actors from a head node, it can easily have out-of-memory problems. In this case, do not run any Tasks and Actors on the head node by specifying --num-cpus=0 when starting a head node by ray start --head. If you use Kuberay, view here.\n\nTo run memory profiling on Ray core components, you can use Jemalloc (https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc). Ray supports environment variables to override LD_PRELOAD on core components. You can find the component name from ray_constants.py. For example, if you\u2019d like to profile gcs_server, search PROCESS_TYPE_GCS_SERVER in ray_constants.py. You can see the value is gcs_server. Users are supposed to provide 3 env vars for memory profiling.\n\nRAY_JEMALLOC_LIB_PATH: The path to the jemalloc shared library so.\nRAY_JEMALLOC_CONF: The MALLOC_CONF of jemalloc (comma separated).",

The context also includes a link to the Ray documentation on how to use the `ray status` command to view detailed cluster status.\n\nBased on this information, it seems that the issue is likely related to the recent failures that have occurred in the cluster. The documentation suggests that the failures may be due to all cluster resources being claimed by actors or Tune trials. The documentation also provides a link to more information on how to use Datasets and Tune trials in a Ray cluster.\n\nTo debug this issue, you may want to try the following steps:\n\n1. Check the Ray logs to see if there are any error messages related to the recent failures.\n2. Check the Ray dashboard to see if there are any issues with the cluster resources or the actors and Tune trials.\n3. Try running the `ray status` command with the `--verbose` flag to get more detailed information about the cluster status.\n4. If the issue persists, you may want to try restarting the Ray cluster to see if that resolves the problem.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the documentation suggests that running multiple Ray Tune jobs on the same cluster at the same time (multi-tenancy) is not officially supported, and that it may be better to use a separate cluster for each tuning job.

The context only provides information about the Ray Serve API and how to catch application-level failures, but it does not provide any information about how to track uncaught exceptions.\n\nTo track uncaught exceptions in Ray Serve, you can use the `ray.exceptions` module, which provides a set of exceptions that can be used to catch and handle different types of errors. For example, you can use the `ray.exceptions.RaySystemError` exception to catch and handle system errors, or the `ray.exceptions.RayTaskError` exception to catch and handle task-related errors.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.util.state.exception` module to catch and handle exceptions related to the state of the Ray system. For example, you can use the `ray.util.state.exception.RayStateApiException` exception to catch and handle exceptions related to the Ray state API.\n\nIt is important to note that uncaught exceptions can cause the Ray Serve application to crash, so it is important to handle them properly to ensure the application continues to run smoothly.",

            "generated_answer": "  To set environment variables in Ray init, you can use the `env_vars` parameter in the `runtime_env` dictionary. For example:\n```\nray.init(\n    runtime_env={\n        \"env_vars\": {\n            \"MY_VAR\": \"my_value\"\n        }\n    }\n)\n```\nThis will set the environment variable `MY_VAR` to `my_value` for all Ray workers.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `worker_process_setup_hook` parameter in the `runtime_env` dictionary to specify a function that will be called on each worker process before it starts. This function can be used to set environment variables or perform other setup tasks. For example:\n```\ndef setup_env():\n    os.environ[\"MY_VAR\"] = \"my_value\"\n\nray.init(\n    runtime_env={\n        \"worker_process_setup_hook\": setup_env\n    }\n)\n```\nThis will set the environment variable `MY_VAR` to `my_value` for all Ray workers.\n\nNote that environment variables set in the `runtime_env` dictionary will override any existing environment variables with the same name on the cluster. If you want to append to an existing environment variable instead of overriding it, you can use the `${ENV_VAR}` syntax to reference the existing variable. For example:\n```\nray.init(\n    runtime_env={\n        \"env_vars\": {\n            \"MY_VAR\": \"${MY_VAR}:my_value\"\n        }\n    }\n)\n```\nThis will set the environment variable `MY_VAR` to `my_value` for all Ray workers, and if `MY_VAR` was already set on the cluster, it will be appended to the existing value.",

You can do this by adding the following lines to the file:\n```\nenv:\n  - name: RAY_GRAFANA_HOST\n    value: http://<head_node_ip>:3000\n  - name: RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST\n    value: http://<head_node_ip>:9090\n```\nReplace `<head_node_ip>` with the IP address of the head node that you noted down in step 1.\n3. Save the `ray-cluster.embed-grafana.yaml` file and run the following command to apply the changes:\n```\nkubectl apply -f ray-cluster.embed-grafana.yaml\n```\nThis will update the environment variables for the Ray cluster and set the `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` and `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST` variables to the correct values.\n\nNote that the `RAY_GRAFANA_IFRAME_HOST` variable is not required if you are using KubeRay, as the Grafana server is already running on the head node.",

Ray writes logs to files in the directory /tmp/ray/session_*/logs on each Ray pod\u2019s file system. You can collect logs written to a pod\u2019s filesystem using one of two logging strategies: sidecar containers or daemonsets. For sidecar containers, you can process logs by configuring a log-processing sidecar for each Ray pod. Ray containers should be configured to share the /tmp/ray directory with the logging sidecar via a volume mount. For daemonsets, you can collect logs at the Kubernetes node level by deploying a log-processing daemonset onto the Kubernetes cluster\u2019s nodes. It is key to mount the Ray container\u2019s /tmp/ray directory to the relevant hostPath.",

            "question": "What are the reasons for a node to change it\u2019s status to dead?",
            "generated_answer": "  The reasons for a node to change its status to dead include:\n\n1. Raylet failure: If a raylet process fails, the corresponding node will be marked as dead and is treated the same as node failure.\n2. Task was killed due to the node running low on memory.\n3. When a worker node fails, the actors running on it also fail. Serve detects that the actors have failed, and it attempts to respawn the actors on the remaining, healthy nodes. Meanwhile, KubeRay detects that the node itself has failed, so it attempts to restart the worker pod on another running node, and it also brings up a new healthy node to replace it. Once the node comes up, if the pod is still pending, it can be restarted on that node. Similarly, Serve can also respawn any pending actors on that node as well.\n4. Rescheduling Bundles on a Dead Node: If nodes that contain some bundles of a placement group die, all the bundles are rescheduled on different nodes by GCS (i.e., we try reserving resources again).\n5. Head node failure: You can simulate a head node failure by either killing the head pod or the head node.\n6. Configuring IAM Role and EC2 Instance Profile: By default, Ray nodes in a Ray AWS cluster have full EC2 and S3 permissions (i.e. arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2FullAccess and arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess). This is a good default for trying out Ray clusters but you may want to change the permissions Ray nodes have for various reasons (e.g. to reduce the permissions for security reasons).\n7. Minimum child weight: When a decision tree creates new leaves, it splits up the remaining data at one node into two groups. If there are only few samples in one of these groups, it often doesn\u2019t make sense to split it further.\n8. Monitoring cluster status (ray dashboard/status): The Ray also comes with an online dashboard. The dashboard is accessible via HTTP on the head node (by default it listens on localhost:8265).\n9. PENDING: The placement group creation is pending scheduling. It could be because there\u2019s not enough resources, some of creation stage has failed (e.g., failed to commit placement gropus because the node is dead).\n10. CREATED: The placement group is created.\n11. REMOVED: The placement group is removed.\n12. RESCHEDULING: The placement group is rescheduling because some of bundles are dead because they were on dead nodes.\n13. NodeAffinitySchedulingStrategy: NodeAffinitySchedulingStrategy is a low-level strategy that allows a task or actor to be scheduled onto a particular node specified by its node id.\n14. Handling Failures and Node Preemption: If enabled, nodes will be stopped when the cluster scales down. If disabled, nodes will be terminated instead. Stopped nodes launch faster than terminated nodes.",
            "reference_answer": "A node can change its status to dead due to a worker node failure, a head node failure, or a raylet failure. In the case of a worker node failure, all running tasks and actors will fail and all objects owned by worker processes of this node will be lost. If a head node fails, the entire Ray cluster fails. When a raylet process fails, the corresponding node will be marked as dead and is treated the same as node failure. Each raylet is associated with a unique id, so even if the raylet restarts on the same physical machine, it\u2019ll be treated as a new raylet/node to the Ray cluster.",

            "reference_answer": "Spikes in node CPU utilization can occur due to the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node. By default, Ray tasks require 1 CPU each and Ray actors require 0 CPU each, so the scheduler limits task concurrency to the available CPUs and actor concurrency to infinite. Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones. Tasks or actors that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM. To manage this, the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node can be reduced by increasing the amount of resources requested by them.",
