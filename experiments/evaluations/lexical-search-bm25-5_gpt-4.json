            "generated_answer": "  \nI would recommend using the \"numpy\" batch format for your Ray Data type conversions when using the map_batches() method. This is because the \"numpy\" batch format is more efficient and can handle larger batch sizes than the \"pandas\" batch format. Additionally, the \"numpy\" batch format is the default batch format used by Ray Data, so you won't need to specify it explicitly in your code.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use the \"numpy\" batch format with the map_batches() method:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Create a Ray dataset\nds = ray.data.read_images(\"s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/image-datasets/simple\")\n\n# Increase the brightness of the images in the dataset\ndef increase_brightness(batch):\n    batch[\"image\"] = np.clip(batch[\"image\"] + 4, 0, 255)\n    return batch\n\n# Apply the increase_brightness function to the dataset\nds = ds.map_batches(increase_brightness, batch_format=\"numpy\")\n```\nIn this example, the increase_brightness function takes a batch of images as a NumPy array and increases the brightness of each image by adding 4 to each pixel value. The batch_format parameter is set to \"numpy\" to specify that the batches should be represented as NumPy arrays.\n\nBy using the \"numpy\" batch format, you can take advantage of the efficiency and performance benefits of NumPy arrays, while still being able to perform data transformations on your Ray Data.",
            "reference_answer": "You can specify the batch format in the map_batches() function. If you're working with NumPy ndarrays, your function should accept and return a dictionary of ndarrays. If you're working with pandas DataFrames, your function should accept and return a DataFrame. Make sure your function is correctly handling the data type you've specified in batch_format.",

            "generated_answer": "  In a Ray Serve application, autoscaling works by automatically increasing or decreasing the number of replicas based on the load of the application. The Ray autoscaler is a process that runs on the head node (or as a sidecar container in the head pod if using Kubernetes) and adjusts the number of nodes in the cluster based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups. The Ray Serve autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that sits on top of the Ray Autoscaler and asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If the Ray Autoscaler determines there aren't enough available CPUs to place these actors, it responds by requesting more Ray nodes, which the underlying cloud provider will then add to the cluster.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas. This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The parameters include min_replicas, initial_replicas, max_replicas, and target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it tries to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

            "generated_answer": "  A batch in Ray Data is a user-facing object that represents a subset of rows from a dataset. It is a collection of data that is processed in parallel. A block, on the other hand, is an internal abstraction that represents a subset of rows from a dataset that is stored in a distributed data store. Blocks are used to perform operations in parallel, and they are the building blocks of a dataset.\n\nIn terms of performance, using a large block size can lead to potential out-of-memory situations, so it is important to make sure that no single item in a Ray Data is too large and to always call `ds.map_batches()` with a batch size small enough that the output batch can comfortably fit into memory.\n\nIn terms of configuration, the search space for a Ray Data search can be configured using the `LightningConfigBuilder` class. This allows you to choose between different layer and batch sizes, as well as sample the learning rate uniformly between 0.0001 and 0.1.\n\nIn terms of serialization, since Ray processes do not share memory space, data transferred between workers and nodes will need to be serialized and deserialized. Ray uses the Plasma object store to efficiently transfer objects across different processes and different nodes. Numpy arrays in the object store are shared between workers on the same node (zero-copy deserialization).\n\nIn terms of compatibility, it is best to match Ray and Autoscaler code versions to support multiple Ray clusters running at different Ray versions. Running one autoscaler per Ray cluster and matching the code versions ensures compatibility.\n\nIn terms of performance considerations, the dataset parallelism determines the number of blocks the base data is split into for parallel reads. Ray Data decides internally how many read tasks to run concurrently to best utilize the cluster, ranging from 1...parallelism tasks. The default parallelism can be overridden via the parallelism argument; see the performance guide for more information on how to tune this read parallelism.\n\nIn terms of inspecting batches, a batch contains data from multiple rows. To inspect batches, call `Dataset.take_batch()`. By default, Ray Data represents batches as dicts of NumPy ndarrays. To change the type of the returned batch, set `batch_format`.",

Check the Ray dashboard to see if there are any deadlocked tasks or actors.\n2. Use the `ray.get_actor_stats()` function to check the status of the rollout workers and see if any of them are deadlocked.\n3. Use the `ray.get_task_stats()` function to check the status of the tasks that are being executed by the rollout workers and see if any of them are deadlocked.\n4. Check the logs of the rollout workers to see if there are any error messages or warnings that may indicate the cause of the deadlock.\n5. Try reducing the number of rollout workers or increasing the resources available to each worker to see if that helps resolve the deadlock.\n6. Check the code of the rollout workers to see if there are any potential deadlocks or race conditions that may be causing the issue.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the `RolloutWorker` class is a subclass of the `ray.rllib.evaluation.worker_set.WorkerSet` class, which provides a way to manage a set of rollout workers. The `WorkerSet` class has a `foreach_worker_async()` method that can be used to call a function asynchronously with each worker as an argument. This method can be useful for debugging purposes, as it allows you to execute a function on each worker in parallel and retrieve the results asynchronously.",
            "reference_answer": "To debug why ray rollout workers are deadlocking when using the sample API in `ray/rllib/evaluation/rollout_worker.py`, you can try setting `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` if you encounter errors like `blas_thread_init: pthread_create: Resource temporarily unavailable` when using many workers. You can also check configured system limits with `ulimit -a` for other resource limit errors. For unexpected hangs or performance problems, you can use `ray stack` to dump the stack traces of all Ray workers on the current node, `ray timeline` to dump a timeline visualization of tasks to a file, and `ray memory` to list all object references in the cluster. If you are developing with TensorFlow, it is recommended to use `framework=tf2` and `eager_tracing=True` for maximum performance and support. For debugging purposes, you should use `framework=tf2` with `eager_tracing=False`. All `tf.Tensor` values will then be visible and printable when executing your code.",

This includes options such as the number of replicas, the resources to be used by each replica, and the deployment's name.\n\nTo use user config in Ray Serve, you can set the `user_config` field in the deployment's configuration file. For example:\n```\ndeployments:\n  - name: MyDeployment\n    user_config:\n      num_replicas: 2\n      resources:\n        cpu: 1\n        memory: 1Gi\n```\nAlternatively, you can set the `user_config` field in the Serve config file. For example:\n```\nserveConfig:\n  deployments:\n    - name: MyDeployment\n      user_config:\n        num_replicas: 2\n        resources:\n          cpu: 1\n          memory: 1Gi\n```\nNote that the `user_config` field is a YAML multi-line string, so you can use any valid YAML syntax to define the configuration options.",

This configuration can be updated dynamically without restarting the replicas of the deployment. The user_config must be fully JSON-serializable. You can use the user_config field to supply structured configuration for your deployment. You can pass arbitrary JSON serializable objects to the YAML configuration. Serve then applies it to all running and future deployment replicas. The application of user configuration does not restart the replica. This means you can use this field to dynamically adjust model weights and versions without restarting the cluster, adjust traffic splitting percentage for your model composition graph, configure any feature flag, A/B tests, and hyper-parameters for your deployments. To enable the user_config feature, you need to implement a reconfigure method that takes a JSON-serializable object (e.g., a Dictionary, List or String) as its only argument. If the user_config is set when the deployment is created (e.g., in the decorator or the Serve config file), this reconfigure method is called right after the deployment\u2019s __init__ method, and the user_config is passed in as an argument. You can also trigger the reconfigure method by updating your Serve config file with a new user_config and reapplying it to your Ray cluster.",

The `resources_per_worker` parameter is set to a dictionary that specifies the resources to allocate to each worker. In this case, each worker will be allocated 1 CPU.\n\nYou can also use the `tune.with_resources` function to specify resources for a trainable. For example:\n```\ntuner = tune.Tuner(\n    tune.with_resources(trainable, resources={\"cpu\": 2, \"gpu\": 0.5, \"custom_resources\": {\"hdd\": 80}}),\n    param_space=space,\n    tune_config=tune.TuneConfig(num_samples=10)\n)\n```\nIn this example, the `tune.with_resources` function is used to specify the resources to allocate to the trainable. The `resources` parameter is set to a dictionary that specifies the resources to allocate. In this case, the trainable will be allocated 2 CPUs, 0.5 GPUs, and 80 units of custom resources.\n\nYou can also use the `run_config` parameter of the Tuner constructor to specify the storage path and name of the experiment.

Improved fault tolerance: Named actors can be used to implement fault-tolerant systems, where the actor can be restarted if it fails, and the system can continue to function even if the actor is restarted.\n5. Better resource management: Named actors can be used to manage resources across different parts of a distributed system, such as scheduling tasks and actors to specific nodes or clusters.\n6.

            "question": "how do I make a Ray Tune trial retry on failures?",
            "generated_answer": "  To make a Ray Tune trial retry on failures, you can use the `ray.train.FailureConfig` class to specify the maximum number of failures allowed for a trial. If a trial encounters an error, the experiment will stop immediately.\n\nHere's an example:\n```python\nfrom ray import train, tune\nimport time\n\ndef my_failing_trainable(config):\n    if config[\"should_fail\"]:\n        raise RuntimeError(\"Failing (on purpose)!\")\n    # Do some training...\n    time.sleep(10)\n    train.report({\"mean_accuracy\": 0.9})\n\n# Set up the experiment\nexperiment = tune.Experiment(\n    name=\"my_experiment\",\n    run=my_failing_trainable,\n    stop={\"mean_accuracy\": 1.0},\n    config={\n        \"should_fail\": tune.grid_search([True, False])\n    },\n    failure_config=train.FailureConfig(max_failures=3)\n)\n\n# Run the experiment\nresults = tune.run(experiment)\n```\nIn this example, the `failure_config` parameter is set to `train.FailureConfig(max_failures=3)`, which means that if a trial encounters an error, the experiment will stop immediately. The `max_failures` parameter specifies the maximum number of failures allowed for a trial.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.tune.Callback.on_trial_error` and `ray.tune.Callback.on_trial_recover` callbacks to handle trial failures and recoveries. These callbacks are called when a trial encounters an error or is recovered, respectively. You can use these callbacks to implement custom logic for handling trial failures and recoveries.\n\nFor example, you can use the `on_trial_error` callback to log the error and stop the experiment, and use the `on_trial_recover` callback to log the recovery and continue the experiment. Here's an example:\n```python\nfrom ray import train, tune\nimport time\n\ndef my_failing_trainable(config):\n    if config[\"should_fail\"]:\n        raise RuntimeError(\"Failing (on purpose)!\")\n    # Do some training...\n    time.sleep(10)\n    train.report({\"mean_accuracy\": 0.9})\n\n# Set up the experiment\nexperiment = tune.Experiment(\n    name=\"my_experiment\",\n    run=my_failing_trainable,\n    stop={\"mean_accuracy\": 1.0},\n    config={\n        \"should_fail\": tune.grid_search([True, False])\n    },\n    callbacks=[\n        tune.Callback.on_trial_error(lambda iteration, trials, trial, **info: print(f\"Trial {trial.trial_id} failed at iteration {iteration}.\"))\n        tune.Callback.on_trial_recover(lambda iteration, trials, trial, **info: print(f\"Trial {trial.trial_id} recovered at iteration {iteration}.\"))\n    ]\n)\n\n# Run the experiment\nresults = tune.run(experiment)\n```\nIn this example, the `on_trial_error` callback is used to log the error and stop the experiment, and the `on_trial_recover` callback is used to log the recovery and continue the experiment.",

This parameter specifies the maximum number of trials that can be run concurrently, and it can be used to limit the memory usage of each trial.\n\nFor example:\n```\nfrom ray.tune import TuneConfig\n\nconfig = TuneConfig(\n    # ...\n    num_samples=100,\n    max_concurrent_trials=10,\n)\n```\nIn this example, the `max_concurrent_trials` parameter is set to 10, which means that at most 10 trials will be run concurrently. This can help to limit the memory usage of each trial and prevent the cluster from running out of memory.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `with_resources` method to specify the resources allocated to each trial. For example:\n```\nfrom ray.tune import TuneConfig\n\nconfig = TuneConfig(\n    # ...\n    num_samples=100,\n    with_resources={\"cpu\": 1},\n)\n```\nIn this example, the `with_resources` parameter is set to `{\"cpu\": 1}`, which means that each trial will be allocated 1 CPU. This can help to limit the memory usage of each trial and prevent the cluster from running out of memory.\n\nIt's important to note that the `max_concurrent_trials` and `with_resources` parameters are not mutually exclusive, and you can use them together to further control the memory usage of each trial.",

            "generated_answer": "  The history of jobs run on a KubeRay cluster is stored in the Global Control Store (GCS) database. The GCS is a key-value store that runs on the head node of the cluster and stores metadata about the cluster and its components. The GCS is used to store information about the jobs that have been run on the cluster, including the job's ID, the number of workers used, and the job's status. The GCS is also used to store information about the cluster's resources, such as the number of available CPUs and GPUs.\n\nThe GCS is implemented using Redis, which is an in-memory data structure store. Redis is used to store the GCS data because it is fast and provides low-latency access to the data. The GCS is also designed to be highly available, with multiple Redis instances running in a cluster to ensure that the data is always available even in the event of a failure.\n\nIn addition to the GCS, KubeRay also uses a separate Redis instance to store the Ray Jobs that have been submitted to the cluster. This allows the Ray Jobs to be recovered in the event of a failure, and allows the cluster to continue running even if the head node crashes.",

Increase the `ray.config.actor_max_size` parameter to a larger value.\n2. Reduce the size of the actor by removing unnecessary dependencies or data.\n3. Use the `ray.put()` function to store large objects in the Ray object store, rather than passing them as arguments to the actor.\n4. Use the `ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy` to parallelize the computation and reduce the memory usage of the actor.\n5. Check if there are any memory leaks in the actor's code or if there are any other issues that are causing the actor to consume too much memory.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the `ImplicitFunc` actor is a built-in actor in Ray, and it's used for executing functions in parallel.

If the client disconnects unexpectedly, i.e. due to a network failure, the client will attempt to reconnect to the server for 30 seconds before all of the references are dropped.

The SDK provides a `JobSubmissionClient` class that allows you to submit jobs programmatically.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `JobSubmissionClient` class to submit a job with Python:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Initialize the client\nclient = ray.job_submission.JobSubmissionClient(\"http://127.0.0.1:8265\")\n\n# Define the job\njob_id = client.submit_job(\n    # Entrypoint shell command to execute\n    entrypoint=\"python script.py\",\n    # Path to the local directory that contains the script.py file\n    runtime_env={\"working_dir\": \"./\"}\n)\n\n# Print the job ID\nprint(job_id)\n```\nIn this example, the `JobSubmissionClient` class is initialized with the address of the Ray cluster head node and the port used by the Ray Dashboard (8265 by default). The `submit_job` method is then called with the entrypoint shell command to execute and the path to the local directory that contains the script.py file. The `submit_job` method returns the job ID, which is printed to the console.\n\nNote that the `runtime_env` argument is used to specify the working directory for the job. This is required for local clusters, but not for remote clusters.\n\nYou can also use the Ray Jobs CLI to submit jobs with Python. The CLI provides a `ray job submit` command that allows you to submit jobs programmatically.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `ray job submit` command to submit a job with Python:\n```\n$ ray job submit --working-dir=\".\" -- python script.py\n```\nIn this example, the `--working-dir` argument is used to specify the path to the local directory that contains the script.py file. The `--` argument is used to separate the arguments to `ray job submit` from the arguments to the entrypoint command.\n\nNote that the `ray job submit` command also supports the use of the `--runtime-env` argument to specify the working directory for the job. This is required for local clusters, but not for remote clusters.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.",

Then, find the HTTP address of the Ray Cluster to which you can submit a job request. This is the same address used by the Ray Dashboard, usually using port 8265. Set the RAY_ADDRESS environment variable to this address. You can also pass headers per HTTP request to the Cluster using the RAY_JOB_HEADERS environment variable. Finally, submit the job using the command 'ray job submit --working-dir your_working_directory -- python script.py'. This will run the script on the Ray Cluster and wait until the job has finished. Ray will also make the contents of the directory passed as --working-dir available to the Ray job by downloading the directory to all nodes in your cluster.",

The context provides an example of how to define an actor and how to use the `ray.get()` method to retrieve the value of a variable defined in the actor's init method.\n\nTo pickle a variable defined in an actor's init method, you can use the `pickle.dumps()` method to serialize the variable and then use the `ray.put()` method to store the serialized data in the actor's state. For example:\n```\nimport pickle\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def __init__(self, global_var_actor):\n        self.global_var_actor = global_var_actor\n        self.pickled_var = pickle.dumps(self.global_var_actor.get_global_var.remote())\n\n    def f(self):\n        return ray.get(self.pickled_var) + 3\n```\nIn this example, the `pickled_var` attribute of the actor is initialized with the serialized value of the `global_var_actor.get_global_var.remote()` method. The `f()` method can then retrieve the value of `pickled_var` using `ray.get()` and perform any necessary operations on it.\n\nNote that this approach assumes that the variable defined in the actor's init method is serializable using pickle. If the variable is not serializable, you may need to use a different approach to store the variable in the actor's state.",

            "generated_answer": "  To write unit tests for Ray code, you can use the `unittest` module in Python. Here's an example of how to write a unit test for a Ray program:\n```\nimport unittest\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n\n    def test_ray_function(self):\n        # Test the Ray function here\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\nIn this example, we define a `RayTest` class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. We then define a `setUp` method that initializes the Ray cluster with 4 CPUs and 0 GPUs. Finally, we define a `test_ray_function` method that tests a Ray function.\n\nTo run the unit test, you can use the `unittest` module's `main` method:\n```\npython -m unittest ray_test.py\n```\nThis will run the `test_ray_function` method and report the results.\n\nNote that this is just a simple example, and you may need to modify it to fit your specific use case. Additionally, you may want to consider using a more advanced testing framework like `pytest` or `nose` to write your unit tests.",

You can start a new Ray cluster for each test in the setUp method and shut it down in the tearDown method. However, starting and stopping a Ray cluster can add significant latency. To reduce this, you can share the Ray cluster across tests by initializing it in the setUpClass method and shutting it down in the tearDownClass method. Be aware that there are certain cases where it may be unsafe to reuse a Ray cluster across tests, such as if your application depends on setting environment variables per process or if your remote actor/task sets any sort of process-level global variables.",

            "question": "How do I list the current Ray actors from python?",
            "generated_answer": "  \n\nThe current Ray actors from Python can be listed using the following command:\n\nray list actors\n\nThis command will list all the actors from the cluster. You can also use the --limit flag to limit the number of actors listed, and the --filter flag to filter the actors based on their state. For example, to list 10 actors with state PENDING, you can use the following command:\n\nray list actors --limit 10 --filter \"state=PENDING\"\n\nYou can also use the --format flag to specify the output format. For example, to list actors with yaml format, you can use the following command:\n\nray list actors --format yaml\n\nYou can also use the --detail flag to get more detailed information about the actors. When --detail is specified, it might query more data sources to obtain data in details. For example, to list actors with details, you can use the following command:\n\nray list actors --detail\n\nYou can also use the ray.util.ActorPool class to operate on a fixed pool of actors. For example, to create an ActorPool with two actors, you can use the following code:\n\nimport ray\nfrom ray.util.actor_pool import ActorPool\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def double(self, v):\n        return 2 * v\n\na1, a2 = Actor.remote(), Actor.remote()\npool = ActorPool([a1, a2])\nprint(list(pool.map(lambda a, v: a.double.remote(v), [1, 2, 3, 4])))\n\nThis will create an ActorPool with two actors and map the double function to the input list [1, 2, 3, 4]. The output will be [2, 4, 6, 8].\n\nYou can also use the ray.nodes() function to get a list of the nodes in the cluster, and the ray.cluster_resources() function to get the current total cluster resources.\n\nYou can also use the ray.available_resources() function to get the current available cluster resources.\n\nYou can also use the ray.util.queue.Queue class to create a first-in, first-out queue implementation on Ray. For example, to create a queue with a maximum size of 10, you can use the following code:\n\nimport ray\nfrom ray.util.queue import Queue\n\nqueue = Queue(maxsize=10)\n\nYou can then use the put() method to add items to the queue, and the get() method to retrieve items from the queue. For example:\n\nqueue.put(1)\nqueue.put(2)\nqueue.put(3)\nprint(queue.get())  # prints 1\nprint(queue.get())  # prints 2\nprint(queue.get())  # prints 3\n\nYou can also use the ray.util.state module to retrieve the log of a specific actor or worker. For example, to retrieve the log of an actor with actor id, you can use the following code:\n\nimport ray\nfrom ray.util.state import get_log\n\n# Get the Actor's ID from the output of `ray list actors`.\nfor line in get_log(actor_id=<ACTOR_ID>):\n    print(line)\n\nYou can also use the ray.util.state module to stream log from an actor or worker. For example, to stream log from an actor with actor id, you can use the following code:\n\nimport ray\nfrom ray.util.state import get_log\n\n# Get the Actor's ID from the output of `ray list actors`.\nfor line in get_log(actor_id=<ACTOR_ID>, follow=True):\n    print(line)\n\nYou can also use the ray.util.state module to retrieve the log of a specific node. For example, to retrieve the log of a node with node ip, you can use the following code:\n\nimport ray\nfrom ray.util.state import get_log\n\n# Retrieve the Node IP from list_nodes() or ray.nodes()\nfor line in get_log(filename=\"raylet.out\", node_ip=<NODE_IP>):\n    print(line)\n\nYou can also use the ray.util.state module to stream log from a node. For example, to stream log from a node with node ip, you can use the following code:\n\nimport ray\nfrom ray.util.state import get_log\n\n# Retrieve the Node IP from list_nodes() or ray.nodes()\nfor line in get_log(filename=\"raylet.out\", node_ip=<NODE_IP>, follow=True):\n    print(line)",

The context provides information on the RayCluster custom resource and the KubeRay operator, which are used to manage Ray clusters on Kubernetes. The context also provides information on the Ray Dashboard, which is used to monitor and debug Ray applications and clusters.\n\nTo manually configure and manage a Ray cluster on Kubernetes, you can use the RayCluster custom resource to define the desired state of the cluster. You can then use the KubeRay operator to manage the Ray pods in order to match the RayCluster's spec. Additionally, you can use the Ray Dashboard to monitor and debug the Ray cluster.\n\nHere is an example of a RayCluster custom resource in yaml format:\n```\napiVersion: ray.io/v1alpha1\nkind: RayCluster\nmetadata:\n  name: raycluster-complete\nspec:\n  rayVersion: \"2.3.0\"\n  enableInTreeAutoscaling: true\n```\nThis RayCluster custom resource defines a Ray cluster with the name \"raycluster-complete\" and the Ray version \"2.3.0\". The \"enableInTreeAutoscaling\" field is set to true, which enables the Ray autoscaler to automatically scale the cluster up and down based on resource demand.\n\nTo manage the Ray cluster, you can use the KubeRay operator to create, update, and delete the RayCluster custom resource. You can also use the Ray Dashboard to monitor and debug the Ray cluster.\n\nFor more information on how to configure and manage a Ray cluster on Kubernetes, you can refer to the RayCluster Configuration and Ray Dashboard guides.",
            "reference_answer": "To manually configure and manage a Ray cluster on Kubernetes, you need to deploy a static Ray cluster into the default namespace. This can be done by applying a sample Ray Cluster from the Ray repo using the command '! kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ray-project/ray/master/doc/source/cluster/kubernetes/configs/static-ray-cluster.with-fault-tolerance.yaml'. The Ray cluster has fault tolerance enabled by default using the external Redis, and you need to set the Redis IP address in the config. Once the Ray cluster has been deployed, you can view the pods for the head node and worker nodes by running '! kubectl get pods'. Wait for the pods to reach the Running state. If your pods are stuck in the Pending state, you can check for errors via 'kubectl describe pod deployment-ray-head-xxxx-xxxxx' and ensure that your Docker resource limits are set high enough.",

            "generated_answer": "  To push a custom module to Ray that is used by an Actor, you can use the `py_modules` field in the `runtime_env` parameter of the `ray.init()` function.\n\nHere is an example:\n```\nimport ray\nimport my_module\n\nray.init(\"ray://123.456.7.89:10001\", runtime_env={\"py_modules\": [my_module]})\n\n@ray.remote\ndef test_my_module():\n    # No need to import my_module inside this function.\n    my_module.test()\n```\nIn this example, `my_module` is a custom module that you have developed. By passing it to the `py_modules` field in the `runtime_env` parameter of `ray.init()`, you are making the module available to all Ray workers, including the Actor.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.util.ActorPool.push()` method to push a new actor into the current list of idle actors. Here is an example:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.util.actor_pool import ActorPool\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def double(self, v):\n        return 2 * v\n\na1, a2 = Actor.remote(), Actor.remote()\npool = ActorPool([a1])\npool.push(a2)\n```\nIn this example, `Actor` is a custom actor class that you have defined. By using the `push()` method of the `ActorPool` class, you are adding a new actor instance to the pool of idle actors.\n\nYou can also call an Actor by using the `ray.remote` decorator and the `Remote` method. Here is an example:\n```\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Counter:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.i = 0\n\n    def get(self):\n        return self.i\n\n    def incr(self, value):\n        self.i += value\n\n# Create a Counter actor.\nc = Counter.remote()\n```\nIn this example, `Counter` is a custom actor class that you have defined. By using the `ray.remote` decorator and the `Remote` method, you are creating a new actor instance and calling its methods.",

For example:\n```\nray.init(runtime_env={\"working_dir\": \"/path/to/new/working/directory\"})\n```\nThis will update the working directory for all Ray workers to the new directory.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `ray.train.get_context().get_trial_dir()` function to get the current trial directory, and then use the `os` module to change the working directory. For example:\n```\nimport os\n\ntrial_dir = ray.train.get_context().get_trial_dir()\nos.chdir(trial_dir)\n```\nThis will change the working directory to the current trial directory.\n\nNote that if you are using a distributed cluster, you may need to use the `ray.init` function with the `namespace` parameter set to the namespace of the cluster, and the `runtime_env` parameter set to the new working directory. For example:\n```\nray.init(namespace=\"my_namespace\", runtime_env={\"working_dir\": \"/path/to/new/working/directory\"})\n```\nThis will update the working directory for all Ray workers in the \"my_namespace\" namespace to the new directory.",

For example:\n```\nfrom ray.train.horovod import HorovodConfig\n\n# Set a timeout of 10 minutes for the Ray job\nray_job = RayJob(HorovodConfig(timeout_s=600))\n```\nAlternatively, you can set the `timeout_s` parameter in the `ray.train.torch.TorchConfig` constructor. For example:\n```\nfrom ray.train.torch import TorchConfig\n\n# Set a timeout of 30 minutes for the Ray job\nray_job = RayJob(TorchConfig(timeout_s=1800))\n```\nNote that the `timeout_s` parameter is in seconds, so the above examples set a timeout of 10 minutes and 30 minutes, respectively.\n\nYou can also set a timeout for the `get` method by passing a `timeout` parameter. For example:\n```\nfrom ray.exceptions import GetTimeoutError\n\n# Set a timeout of 5 seconds for the `get` method\ntry:\n    ray.get(obj_ref, timeout=5)\nexcept GetTimeoutError:\n    print(\"`get` timed out.\")\n```\nThis will raise a `GetTimeoutError` if the `get` method does not complete within 5 seconds.",

These APIs allow you to retrieve log files from a specific node in the cluster, or from a specific entity (such as a task or actor) that was running on that node.\n\nTo use these APIs, you will need to provide the address of the Ray cluster, as well as the node ID or node IP of the node that you want to access logs for. You can also specify the name of the log file that you want to retrieve, or the ID of the actor or task that you want to get logs for.\n\nHere is an example of how you might use these APIs to access logs for a dead node:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Connect to the Ray cluster\nray.init()\n\n# Get the node ID of the dead node\ndead_node_id = ray.util.state.list_nodes(dead=True)[0]\n\n# Get the log files for the dead node\nlog_files = ray.util.state.list_logs(node_id=dead_node_id)\n\n# Print the contents of the log files\nfor log_file in log_files:\n    print(ray.util.state.get_log(node_id=dead_node_id, filename=log_file))\n```\nThis code will connect to the Ray cluster, retrieve the ID of the dead node, and then use the `list_logs` and `get_log` APIs to retrieve and print the contents of the log files for that node.",
            "reference_answer": "To access logs for a dead node, you can use log processing tools like Fluent Bit, Vector, Fluentd, Filebeat, and Promtail. Ray writes logs to files in the directory /tmp/ray/session_*/logs on each Ray pod\u2019s file system. You can collect logs written to a pod\u2019s filesystem using one of two logging strategies: sidecar containers or daemonsets. For sidecar containers, you can process logs by configuring a log-processing sidecar for each Ray pod. Ray containers should be configured to share the /tmp/ray directory with the logging sidecar via a volume mount. For daemonsets, you can collect logs at the Kubernetes node level by deploying a log-processing daemonset onto the Kubernetes cluster\u2019s nodes. It is key to mount the Ray container\u2019s /tmp/ray directory to the relevant hostPath.",

However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the spikes in CPU utilization are likely caused by the following factors:\n\n1. Increased demand for CPU resources: The provided context mentions that the node's memory usage is at 96.22%, which is close to the memory usage threshold of 95%. This could indicate that the node is running low on memory, and the CPU is being used to manage the memory usage.\n2. Task scheduling: The context mentions that Ray is scheduling tasks on the node, which could also contribute to the spike in CPU utilization.\n3. Resource contention: The context mentions that the node is running low on memory, which could lead to resource contention between the tasks running on the node. This could cause the CPU utilization to spike as the tasks compete for resources.\n\nIt is important to note that these are just potential causes and that the actual reasons for the spikes in CPU utilization may be different in the specific case being analyzed.",
            "reference_answer": "Spikes in node CPU utilization can occur due to the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node. By default, Ray tasks require 1 CPU each and Ray actors require 0 CPU each, so the scheduler limits task concurrency to the available CPUs and actor concurrency to infinite. Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones. Tasks or actors that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM. To manage this, the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node can be reduced by increasing the amount of resources requested by them.",

            "generated_answer": "  To avoid objects not getting spilled, you can use the following strategies:\n\n1. Use NVMe SSDs (or other high-performance storage) if possible.\n2. Configure the directory where objects are spilled to using the `object_spilling_config` parameter in the `ray.init()` function.\n3. Avoid passing large objects as values in the search space, as that will incur a performance overhead. Instead, use `tune.with_parameters` to pass large objects in or load them inside your trainable from disk (making sure that all nodes have access to the files) or cloud storage.\n4. Prevent running out of disk space by local object spilling by setting the `local_fs_capacity_threshold` parameter in the `ray.init()` function.\n5. Monitor cluster-wide spill stats using the `ray memory` command to ensure that spilling is happening and to identify any potential issues.",
            "reference_answer": "To avoid objects not getting spilled in Ray, you can configure the directory where objects are spilled to. You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open). It is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. Spilling to multiple remote storages is also supported.",

It allows you to turn your functions and classes into Ray tasks and actors, and work with Ray objects. You can run functions as remote tasks in the cluster by decorating your function with @ray.remote and calling the function with .remote(). Ray also provides actors to parallelize computation across multiple actor instances. When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance of that class in the cluster. This actor can then execute remote method calls and maintain its own internal state. Ray stores task and actor call results in its distributed object store, returning object references that can be later retrieved.",
