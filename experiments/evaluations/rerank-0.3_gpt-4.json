The Ray Serve autoscaler asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand, and if the Ray Autoscaler determines there aren't enough available CPUs to place these actors, it responds by requesting more Ray nodes. The underlying cloud provider will then respond by adding more nodes. There are several user-specified parameters that the autoscaling algorithm takes into consideration when deciding the target number of replicas for the deployment, such as min_replicas and max_replicas.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas. This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The parameters include min_replicas, initial_replicas, max_replicas, and target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it tries to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

            "question": "how to scatter actors across the cluster?",
            "generated_answer": "  To scatter actors across the cluster, you can use the `scheduling_strategy` parameter in the `@ray.remote` decorator. For example:\n```\n@ray.remote(scheduling_strategy=\"SPREAD\")\ndef spread_func():\n    return 2\n\n# Spread tasks across the cluster.\n[spread_func.remote() for _ in range(10)]\n\n# Spread actors across the cluster.\nactors = [SpreadActor.options(scheduling_strategy=\"SPREAD\").remote() for _ in range(10)]\n```\nIn this example, the `SPREAD` strategy will try to spread the tasks or actors among available nodes.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `ScalingConfig` parameter in the `tune.Tuner` constructor to control the placement of actors. For example:\n```\ntuner = tune.Tuner(\n    tune.with_resources(\n        train_fn,\n        resources=ScalingConfig(\n            trainer_resources={\"CPU\": 2, \"GPU\": 0.5, \"hdd\": 80},\n            num_workers=2,\n            resources_per_worker={\"CPU\": 1},\n        ),\n    )\n)\ntuner.fit()\n```\nIn this example, the `ScalingConfig` parameter specifies the resources required for each worker, and the `num_workers` parameter specifies the number of workers to use. The `resources_per_worker` parameter specifies the resources required for each worker.\n\nYou can also use the `location` field of the `http_options` parameter in the `ray.serve.HTTPProxy` constructor to run a proxy on each node in the cluster. For example:\n```\nray.serve.HTTPProxy(\n    \"my_service\",\n    http_options={\n        \"location\": \"node1:8000\",\n        \"location\": \"node2:8000\",\n        \"location\": \"node3:8000\",\n    },\n)\n```\nIn this example, the `location` field specifies the node and port to use for each proxy.\n\nTo create an instance of the progress actor, simply call the `ActorClass.remote()` method with arguments to the constructor. This creates and runs the actor on a remote worker process. The return value of `ActorClass.remote(...)` is an actor handle that can be used to call its methods. For example:\n```\nprogress_actor = ProgressActor.remote(TOTAL_NUM_SAMPLES)\n```\nIn this example, the `ProgressActor` class is defined with a constructor that takes a single argument, `TOTAL_NUM_SAMPLES`. The `remote()` method is called on the `ProgressActor` class to create an instance of the actor, passing `TOTAL_NUM_SAMPLES` as an argument to the constructor. The return value of `remote()` is an actor handle that can be used to call methods on the actor.",

            "generated_answer": "  To set up the model to communicate gradient updates across machines using Ray AIR, you need to define a parameter server that will hold a copy of the model and apply the gradients received from the workers.\n\nHere's an example of how to define the parameter server using Ray AIR:\n```python\n@ray.remote\nclass ParameterServer(object):\n    def __init__(self, lr):\n        self.model = ConvNet()\n        self.optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(self.model.parameters(), lr=lr)\n\n    def apply_gradients(self, gradients):\n        self.optimizer.zero_grad()\n        for param, grad in gradients:\n            param.grad = grad\n        self.optimizer.step()\n        return self.model.state_dict()\n```\nIn this example, the `ParameterServer` class is defined with an `__init__` method that initializes the model and optimizer, and an `apply_gradients` method that applies the gradients received from the workers and updates the model.\n\nTo use the parameter server in the training loop, you can create an instance of the `ParameterServer` class and use it to apply the gradients received from the workers. Here's an example of how to do this:\n```python\n# Create an instance of the parameter server\nps = ParameterServer.remote(1e-2)\n\n# Train the model in parallel\nfor epoch in range(num_epochs):\n    # Compute the gradients for each worker\n    gradients = []\n    for worker in workers:\n        gradients.append(worker.compute_gradients.remote(current_weights))\n\n    # Apply the gradients to the model using the parameter server\n    current_weights = ps.apply_gradients.remote(gradients)\n```\nIn this example, the `ParameterServer` instance `ps` is created and used to apply the gradients received from the workers using the `apply_gradients` method.

In other words, \"PACK\" tries to minimize the number of nodes used, while \"SPREAD\" tries to maximize the number of nodes used.\n\nFor example, if you have three bundles with the same resource requirements, the \"PACK\" strategy will try to place all three bundles on the same node, while the \"SPREAD\" strategy will try to place each bundle on a different node.\n\nThe \"STRICT_PACK\" and \"STRICT_SPREAD\" strategies are variations of \"PACK\" and \"SPREAD\", respectively, that enforce a stricter placement policy. \"STRICT_PACK\" requires that all bundles be placed on the same node, while \"STRICT_SPREAD\" requires that each bundle be placed on a different node.\n\nIn summary, the main difference between \"PACK\" and \"SPREAD\" is the trade-off between minimizing the number of nodes used and maximizing the number of nodes used. \"PACK\" tries to minimize the number of nodes used, while \"SPREAD\" tries to maximize the number of nodes used.",

This method returns a list of Ray object references to the NumPy ndarrays, which can be used to read the data without copying it.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `to_numpy_refs()` method:\n```\nimport ray\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create a Ray dataset from a list of NumPy arrays\nds = ray.data.from_numpy([np.zeros(100), np.zeros(100)])\n\n# Convert the dataset into a distributed set of NumPy ndarrays\nrefs = ds.to_numpy_refs()\n\n# Access the data in the NumPy ndarrays without copying it\narr1 = ray.get(refs[0])\narr2 = ray.get(refs[1])\n```\nNote that the `to_numpy_refs()` method only works for datasets that can be converted to NumPy ndarrays. If your dataset contains non-NumPy data, you will need to use a different method to access the data.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the `to_numpy_refs()` method only provides zero-copy access to the data. If you need to mutate the data, you will need to manually copy the array at the destination (e.g., `arr = arr.copy()`). Note that this is effectively like disabling the zero-copy deserialization feature provided by Ray.",

Finally, we call the `allreduce` function on the list of tensors, passing in the name of the collective group to use.\n\nNote that the `allreduce` function returns a list of tensors, where each tensor is the result of the all-reduce operation on the corresponding input tensor.",

Here's an example of how to write a unit test for a Ray program:\n```\nimport unittest\nimport ray\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n\n    def test_ray_function(self):\n        # Test the Ray function here\n        pass\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        ray.shutdown()\n        assert not ray.is_initialized()\n```\nIn this example, we define a `RayTest` class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. We then define a `setUp` method that initializes the Ray cluster with 4 CPUs and 0 GPUs. We also define a `test_ray_function` method that tests the Ray function. Finally, we define a `tearDown` method that shuts down the Ray cluster and checks that it is no longer initialized.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.cluster_utils.Cluster` class to create a mini-cluster for testing. Here's an example of how to use this class:\n```\nimport unittest\nimport ray\nfrom ray.cluster_utils import Cluster\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        self.cluster = Cluster()\n        self.cluster.start()\n\n    def test_ray_function(self):\n        # Test the Ray function here\n        pass\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        self.cluster.shutdown()\n        assert not ray.is_initialized()\n```\nIn this example, we define a `RayTest` class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. We then define a `setUp` method that starts a mini-cluster using the `Cluster` class. We also define a `test_ray_function` method that tests the Ray function. Finally, we define a `tearDown` method that shuts down the mini-cluster and checks that it is no longer initialized.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.serve.handle` class to test Ray Serve deployments. Here's an example of how to use this class:\n```\nimport unittest\nimport ray\nfrom ray.serve.handle import RayServeHandle\n\nclass RayServeTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        self.serve_handle = RayServeHandle()\n\n    def test_ray_serve_deployment(self):\n        # Test the Ray Serve deployment here\n        pass\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        self.serve_handle.shutdown()\n        assert not ray.is_initialized()\n```\nIn this example, we define a `RayServeTest` class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. We then define a `setUp` method that creates a `RayServeHandle` object. We also define a `test_ray_serve_deployment` method that tests the Ray Serve deployment. Finally, we define a `tearDown` method that shuts down the `RayServeHandle` object and checks that it is no longer initialized.",
            "reference_answer": "To write unit tests for Ray code, you can use the unittest module in Python. You can start a new Ray cluster for each test in the setUp method and shut it down in the tearDown method. However, starting and stopping a Ray cluster can add significant latency. To reduce this, you can share the Ray cluster across tests by initializing it in the setUpClass method and shutting it down in the tearDownClass method. Be aware that there are certain cases where it may be unsafe to reuse a Ray cluster across tests, such as if your application depends on setting environment variables per process or if your remote actor/task sets any sort of process-level global variables.",

This method shuffles a subset of rows up to a provided buffer size during iteration, which can be more efficient than shuffling all rows.\n\nYou can also use the `use_push_based_shuffle` flag to enable a more efficient shuffle implementation.

            "generated_answer": "  To perform batch inference with GPT-2 on text data from an S3 bucket using Ray Data, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Load the text data from the S3 bucket into a Ray Dataset using `ray.data.read_text()`.\n2. Define a callable class that sets up and invokes the GPT-2 model. This class should have a constructor that loads the model and a `__call__()` method that takes a batch of text data as input and returns the model's predictions.\n3. Use `Dataset.map_batches()` to apply the callable class to each batch of text data in the dataset. This will perform the batch inference using the GPT-2 model.\n4. Save the results of the batch inference to a new dataset or to a file in S3.\n\nHere's an example code snippet that demonstrates this process:\n```python\nimport ray\nfrom ray.data import read_text\nfrom ray.data.dataset import Dataset\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\n# Load the text data from S3\nds = read_text(\"s3://my-bucket/my-data.txt\")\n\n# Define a callable class that sets up and invokes the GPT-2 model\nclass GPT2Model:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.model = pipeline(\"text-classification\")\n\n    def __call__(self, batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, list]:\n        predictions = self.model(list(batch[\"text\"]))\n        batch[\"label\"] = [prediction[\"label\"] for prediction in predictions]\n        return batch\n\n# Perform batch inference using the GPT-2 model\nds_infer = ds.map_batches(GPT2Model, compute=ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy(size=2))\n\n# Save the results of the batch inference to a new dataset\nds_infer.write(\"s3://my-bucket/my-inferred-data.txt\")\n```\nIn this example, we first load the text data from an S3 bucket using `ray.data.read_text()`. We then define a callable class `GPT2Model` that sets up and invokes the GPT-2 model. This class has a constructor that loads the model and a `__call__()` method that takes a batch of text data as input and returns the model's predictions.\n\nWe then use `Dataset.map_batches()` to apply the `GPT2Model` class to each batch of text data in the dataset. This performs the batch inference using the GPT-2 model. Finally, we save the results of the batch inference to a new dataset using `Dataset.write()`.\n\nNote that in this example, we use `ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy(size=2)` to specify that we want to use two GPUs for the batch inference.

            "question": "I want to kill the replica actor from Python. how do I do it?",
            "generated_answer": "  To kill a replica actor from Python, you can use the `ray.kill` function and pass the actor handle as an argument. For example:\n```\nimport ray\n\nreplica_handle = ray.get_actor(\"SERVE_REPLICA::SleepyPid#RlRptP\", namespace=\"serve\")\nray.kill(replica_handle, no_restart=True)\n```\nThis will kill the replica actor forcefully, interrupting any running tasks and causing them to fail immediately. Any atexit handlers installed in the actor will not be run.\n\nIf you want to kill the actor but let pending tasks finish, you can call `actor.__ray_terminate__.remote()` instead to queue a termination task. Any atexit handlers installed in the actor will be run in this case.\n\nIf the actor is a detached actor, subsequent calls to get its handle via `ray.get_actor` will fail.\n\nNote that this method of termination waits until any previously submitted tasks finish executing and then exits the process gracefully with `sys.exit`. You could see the actor is dead as a result of the user\u2019s `exit_actor()` call:\n```\n# This API is only available when you download Ray via `pip install \"ray[default]\"`\nray list actors --detail\n```\nThis will list all actors in the current namespace, along with their details.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `ray.kill` function to manually terminate an actor forcefully, without waiting for pending tasks to finish. This should be reserved for cases where an actor is unexpectedly hanging or leaking resources, and for detached actors, which must be manually destroyed.\n\nFor example:\n```\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    pass\n\nactor_handle = Actor.remote()\n\nray.kill(actor_handle)\n```\nThis will kill the actor process and release resources associated/assigned to the actor.\n\nNote that this approach should generally not be necessary as actors are automatically garbage collected. The ObjectRef resulting from the task can be waited on to wait for the actor to exit (calling `ray.get()` on it will raise a `RayActorError`).\n\nIn some cases, you may need to manually terminate an actor from within one of the actor methods. This can be done by calling `ray.actor.exit_actor()`.\n\nFor example:\n```\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def exit(self):\n        ray.actor.exit_actor()\n\nactor = Actor.remote()\nactor.exit.remote()\n```\nThis will kill the actor process and release resources associated/assigned to the actor.\n\nNote that it does not need to be the original handle to the actor. You can also use `ray.kill` to manually terminate an actor from within another actor method.\n\nIf `max_restarts` is set, you can also allow Ray to automatically restart the actor by passing `no_restart=False` to `ray.kill`. For example:\n```\nimport ray\n\nproxy_handle = ray.get_actor(\"SERVE_CONTROLLER_ACTOR:SERVE_PROXY_ACTOR-91f9a685e662313a0075efcb7fd894249a5bdae7ee88837bea7985a0\", namespace=\"serve\")\nray.kill(proxy_handle, no_restart=False)\n```\nThis will kill the proxy actor forcefully, interrupting any running tasks and causing them to fail immediately. Any atexit handlers installed in the actor will not be run.\n\nIf you want to kill the actor but let pending tasks finish, you can call `actor.__ray_terminate__.remote()` instead to queue a termination task. Any atexit handlers installed in the actor will be run in this case.\n\nIf the actor is a detached actor, subsequent calls to get its handle via `ray.get_actor` will fail.\n\nNote that this method of termination waits until any previously submitted tasks finish executing and then exits the process gracefully with `sys.exit`.

The `options` method is used to configure the Actor instantiation parameters, including the name of the Actor. The `remote` method is used to create an instance of the `Counter` Actor and the `get_actor` method is used to retrieve the Actor later.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.util.ActorPool` class to push a custom module to Ray that uses an Actor. The `ActorPool` class provides a way to manage a pool of Actors and schedule tasks on them.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `ActorPool` class to push a custom module to Ray that uses an Actor:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.util.actor_pool import ActorPool\n\n# Define the Counter actor\n@ray.remote\nclass Counter:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.i = 0\n\n    def get(self):\n        return self.i\n\n    def incr(self, value):\n        self.i += value\n\n# Create an ActorPool with a single Counter actor\npool = ActorPool([Counter.remote()])\n\n# Schedule a task on the Counter actor\npool.push(Counter.remote())\n\n# Retrieve the actor later somewhere\ncounter = pool.get_actor(\"some_name\")\n```\nIn this example, the `Counter` class is defined with the `ray.remote` decorator, which allows it to be used as an Actor. The `ActorPool` class is used to create a pool of Actors and schedule tasks on them. The `push` method is used to add a new Counter actor to the pool and the `get_actor` method is used to retrieve the Actor later.",

To access the Ray Dashboard from outside the head node, you need to set up port forwarding.\n\nYou can use the `ray dashboard` command to set up port forwarding automatically. The command takes the cluster configuration file as an argument and forwards the dashboard port to your local machine.\n\nFor example, if your cluster configuration file is named `cluster.yaml`, you can run the following command to set up port forwarding:\n```\nray dashboard cluster.yaml\n```\nThis will forward the dashboard port to your local machine at `localhost:8265`. You can then access the Ray Dashboard in your local browser at `http://localhost:8265`.\n\nNote that you need to have the `RAY_ADDRESS` environment variable set to `http://127.0.0.1:8265` in order to use the Jobs CLI on your local machine to interact with your remote Ray cluster.",

This can improve performance by reducing the amount of data movement required for shuffling.\n\nNote that the `local_shuffle_buffer_size` parameter only affects the shuffling of the data during the `map_batches()` operation. If you want to shuffle the data in a different way, you can use the `random_shuffle()` method or the `sort()` method, which both support the `local_shuffle_buffer_size` parameter.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the `local_shuffle_buffer_size` parameter only affects the performance of the shuffling operation, and it does not affect the overall performance of the `map_batches()` operation.

            "generated_answer": "  To get more detailed errors or logs from Ray Serve, you can use the following mechanisms:\n\n1. Catch application-level failures: Ray surfaces application-level failures as Python-level exceptions. When a task on a remote worker or actor fails due to a Python-level exception, Ray wraps the original exception in a RayTaskError and stores this as the task\u2019s return value. This wrapped exception will be thrown to any worker that tries to get the result, either by calling ray.get or if the worker is executing another task that depends on the object.\n2. Ray logging: Ray Serve uses Python\u2019s standard logging module with a logger named \"ray.serve\". By default, logs are emitted from actors both to stderr and on disk on each node at /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/. This includes both system-level logs from the Serve controller and proxy as well as access logs and custom user logs produced from within deployment replicas. In development, logs are streamed to the driver Ray program (the Python script that calls serve.run() or the serve run CLI command), so it\u2019s convenient to keep the driver running while debugging.\n3. Fault tolerance: Ray provides mechanisms to catch errors, retry failed code, and handle misbehaving code. See the pages for task and actor fault tolerance for more information on these mechanisms.\n4. Testing: We strongly recommend that you test your Ray Serve script locally or in a RayCluster before deploying it to a RayService. Please refer to rayserve-dev-doc.md for more details.\n5. Error handling: Ray APIs are future APIs (indeed, it is possible to convert Ray object references to standard Python future APIs), and the error handling model is the same. When any remote Tasks or Actors fail, the returned object ref contains an exception. When you call get API to the object ref, it raises an exception.",

The Kuberay operator logs contain information about the Serve application deployment event and Serve application health checks.\n\nAlternatively, you can check the controller log and deployment log, which are located under `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/` in both the head node pod and worker node pod. These logs contain information about specific deployment failure reasons and autoscaling events.\n\nYou can also use the Ray Dashboard to get a high-level overview of your Ray cluster and Ray Serve application\u2019s states. The Ray Dashboard is available both during local testing and on a remote cluster in production. Ray Serve provides some in-built metrics and logging as well as utilities for adding custom metrics and logs in your application.

You can collect logs written to a pod\u2019s filesystem using one of two logging strategies: sidecar containers or daemonsets. For sidecar containers, you can process logs by configuring a log-processing sidecar for each Ray pod. Ray containers should be configured to share the /tmp/ray directory with the logging sidecar via a volume mount. For daemonsets, you can collect logs at the Kubernetes node level by deploying a log-processing daemonset onto the Kubernetes cluster\u2019s nodes.

            "reference_answer": "Spikes in node CPU utilization can occur due to the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node. By default, Ray tasks require 1 CPU each and Ray actors require 0 CPU each, so the scheduler limits task concurrency to the available CPUs and actor concurrency to infinite. Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones. Tasks or actors that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM. To manage this, the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node can be reduced by increasing the amount of resources requested by them.",

            "generated_answer": "  To avoid objects not getting spilled, you can use the following strategies:\n\n1. Use NVMe SSDs or other high-performance storage: This can help reduce the performance impact of object spilling.\n2. Increase the capacity of the object store: You can do this by increasing the memory available to the object store or by using a distributed object store.\n3. Configure object spilling to use multiple directories: This can help spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices, reducing the risk of running out of disk space.\n4. Adjust the local disk utilization threshold: You can adjust the threshold to a value that is appropriate for your use case, or set it to 1 to disable the protection.\n5. Use a faster disk: If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling.\n\nIt is important to note that object spilling can cause significant performance problems, so it is recommended to use these strategies only if necessary.",
            "reference_answer": "To avoid objects not getting spilled in Ray, you can configure the directory where objects are spilled to. You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open). It is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. Spilling to multiple remote storages is also supported.",

It allows you to turn your functions and classes into Ray tasks and actors, and work with Ray objects. You can run functions as remote tasks in the cluster by decorating your function with @ray.remote and calling the function with .remote(). Ray also provides actors to parallelize computation across multiple actor instances. When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance of that class in the cluster. This actor can then execute remote method calls and maintain its own internal state.
