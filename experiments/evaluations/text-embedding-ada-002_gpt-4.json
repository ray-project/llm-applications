The Ray autoscaler adjusts the number of worker nodes in the cluster based on the resource demands of the Ray workload. It reacts to task and actor resource requests, rather than application metrics or physical resource utilization. Autoscaling can be configured in the Serve config by setting the autoscaling field. In a KubeRay Cluster, autoscaling can be enabled by setting enableInTreeAutoscaling to True. The Ray autoscaler has fine-grained control over scale-down, allowing it to select precisely which pods to scale down.",

This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The parameters include min_replicas, initial_replicas, max_replicas, and target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it tries to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

            "generated_answer": "To debug the issue of worker nodes dying due to memory pressure, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. Check the logs of the raylet on the specific node where the worker died. Use the command `ray logs raylet.out -ip <node_ip>` to see more information about the workers killed on that node.\n\n2. Review the error messages from the dead worker's logs. Look for any specific error messages related to out-of-memory (OOM) issues or missing libraries. These error messages can provide clues about the root cause of the worker's termination.\n\n3. Consider the possibility of OOM errors being caused by the Linux out-of-memory killer. When the out-of-memory killer terminates tasks or actors, the exact root cause may not be captured. If you called `ray.get` on the tasks or actors executed by the dead worker, it may raise an exception indicating that the worker was killed unexpectedly.\n\n4. If there are any missing libraries mentioned in the error messages, ensure that they are installed properly. For example, in the provided context, there are warnings related to missing TensorRT libraries. Make sure these libraries are installed correctly if you intend to use Nvidia GPU with TensorRT.\n\n5. Optionally, you can enable verbose progress reporting by setting `ray.data.DataContext.get_current().execution_options.verbose_progress = True`. This can provide more detailed progress information during training.\n\n6. If you are using TensorFlow, consider setting the environment variable `TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS=0` to turn off oneDNN custom operations. This can help avoid slightly different numerical results due to floating-point round-off errors from different computation orders.\n\n7. If the issue persists, refer to the documentation on how to address out-of-memory issues in Ray. The documentation provides guidance on Ray OOM prevention and how to handle memory pressure effectively.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to debug the worker node dying issue and identify the underlying cause.",

            "generated_answer": "The GCS server, or Global Control Service, is a centralized metadata server for a Ray cluster. It manages node membership, actor directory, and other cluster-level operations. It runs on the Ray head node and is also known as the Global Control Store.\n\nIf your GCS server is taking up a lot of memory on the head node, it could be due to the memory-demanding nature of system components like GCS or the dashboard. Running tasks and actors from the head node can easily lead to out-of-memory problems, especially if the head node has the same memory capacity as worker nodes. To mitigate this, you can avoid running tasks and actors on the head node by specifying \"--num-cpus=0\" when starting a head node.\n\nAdditionally, when deploying a large cluster, the head node may experience extra stress due to additional system processes running on it, such as GCS. It is recommended to have a head node with sufficient hardware specifications, such as 8 CPUs and 32 GB memory, although the actual specification depends on the workload and cluster size.\n\nTo make the GCS fault tolerant, HA Redis is required. By default, the GCS is not fault tolerant as all the data is stored in-memory. If the GCS fails, the entire Ray cluster fails. However, with HA Redis, the GCS can recover by loading all the data from the Redis instance and resume regular functions.\n\nIn Ray 2.0, KubeRay added experimental support for GCS fault tolerance, preventing the Ray cluster from crashing if the head node goes down. Serve applications can still handle traffic via worker nodes during the recovery period, but cannot be updated or recover from other failures. GCS fault tolerance can be enabled on KubeRay by adding an external Redis server and modifying the RayService Kubernetes object.\n\nIf you encounter error messages related to too many open files, it is common for the head node GCS process because it is a centralized component that many other components in Ray communicate with. To address this, you can adjust the max file descriptors limit per process using the ulimit command. It is recommended to apply \"ulimit -n 65536\" to your host configuration or selectively apply it for Ray components.",

If an exception occurs, Ray will drop into the debugger instead of propagating it further. You can then use the \"ray debug\" command to inspect the state and debug the issue.",
            "reference_answer": "To track an uncaught exception in Ray Serve, you can leverage Ray's logging system. Ray Serve uses Python\u2019s standard logging module with a logger named 'ray.serve'. By default, logs are emitted from actors both to stderr and on disk on each node at /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/. This includes system-level logs from the Serve controller and proxy as well as access logs and custom user logs produced from within deployment replicas. You can parse these stored logs with a logging stack such as ELK or Loki to be able to search by deployment or replica. Serve supports Log Rotation of these logs through setting the environment variables RAY_ROTATION_MAX_BYTES and RAY_ROTATION_BACKUP_COUNT. To silence the replica-level logs or otherwise configure logging, configure the 'ray.serve' logger inside the deployment constructor.",

Instead, the Ray autoscaler, a Ray cluster process, automatically scales a cluster up and down based on resource demand. It adjusts the number of nodes (Ray pods) in the cluster based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups. The autoscaler also removes nodes after they become idle for some time. A node is considered idle if it has no active tasks, actors, or objects.",

You can collect logs written to a pod\u2019s filesystem using one of two logging strategies: sidecar containers or daemonsets. For sidecar containers, you can process logs by configuring a log-processing sidecar for each Ray pod. Ray containers should be configured to share the /tmp/ray directory with the logging sidecar via a volume mount. For daemonsets, you can collect logs at the Kubernetes node level by deploying a log-processing daemonset onto the Kubernetes cluster\u2019s nodes.

By default, Ray tasks require 1 CPU each and Ray actors require 0 CPU each, so the scheduler limits task concurrency to the available CPUs and actor concurrency to infinite. Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones. Tasks or actors that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM. To manage this, the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node can be reduced by increasing the amount of resources requested by them.",

You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open).

Ray also provides actors to parallelize computation across multiple actor instances. When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance of that class in the cluster.
