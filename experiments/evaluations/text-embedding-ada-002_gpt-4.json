The Ray autoscaler is a process that runs on the head node or as a sidecar container in the head pod if using Kubernetes. It reacts to task and actor resource requests, and not application metrics or physical resource utilization. To enable autoscaling in a KubeRay Cluster, you need to set enableInTreeAutoscaling to True. Additionally, there are other options available to configure the autoscaling behavior.",

This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The parameters include min_replicas, initial_replicas, max_replicas, and target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it tries to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

You can use the `@ray.remote(scheduling_strategy=\"SPREAD\")` decorator to specify this strategy for a remote function or actor.\n\nFor example:\n```\n@ray.remote(scheduling_strategy=\"SPREAD\")\ndef spread_func() -> int:\n    return 2\n\n# Spread tasks across the cluster.\n[spread_func.remote() for _ in range(10)]\n\n# Spread actors across the cluster.\nactors = [SpreadActor.options(scheduling_strategy=\"SPREAD\").remote() for _ in range(10)]\n```\nAlternatively, you can use placement groups to spread actors across the cluster. Placement groups allow you to reserve groups of resources across multiple nodes and schedule tasks and actors packed as close as possible for locality or spread apart.\n\nFor example:\n```\n# Create a placement group with the \"SPREAD\" strategy.\npg = ray.util.placement_group(strategy=\"SPREAD\")\n\n# Create a remote function that uses the placement group.\n@ray.remote(placement_group=pg)\ndef spread_func() -> int:\n    return 2\n\n# Spread tasks across the cluster using the placement group.\n[spread_func.remote() for _ in range(10)]\n```\nIt's important to note that the \"SPREAD\" strategy is not always the best choice for all workloads.

The `SyncConfig` object takes a list of directories to sync as its first argument.\n\nHere is an example of how to configure SyncConfig for a Ray AIR job:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.train import RunConfig, SyncConfig\n\n# Set the storage path for the job\nstorage_path = \"s3://your/bucket\"\n\n# Create a SyncConfig object\nsync_config = SyncConfig(\n    upload_dir=storage_path,\n    syncer=None,\n)\n\n# Create a RunConfig object with the SyncConfig\nrun_config = RunConfig(\n    storage_path=storage_path,\n    sync_config=sync_config,\n)\n\n# Start the Ray AIR job\nray.init(run_config=run_config)\n```\nIn this example, the `storage_path` variable is set to a cloud storage bucket, and the `SyncConfig` object is created with the `upload_dir` parameter set to the same bucket. The `syncer` parameter is set to `None`, which means that the default syncer will be used.\n\nYou can also use a network filesystem mounted on all nodes as the storage path, and set the `sync_config` parameter to a `SyncConfig` object with the `upload_dir` parameter set to the NFS mount point.\n\nNote that you should only use a network filesystem mounted on all nodes if you are sure that the filesystem is available and accessible from all nodes in the cluster.",

The error message mentions that the rollout workers are deadlocking, which could be caused by a variety of factors, such as resource constraints or issues with the Ray cluster.\n\nTo debug the issue, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Check the Ray cluster status to ensure that there are enough resources available for the rollout workers. You can use the `ray status` command to check the cluster status.\n2. Check the Ray worker logs to see if there are any error messages or warnings that could indicate the cause of the deadlock. You can use the `ray logs` command to view the worker logs.\n3. Try reducing the number of rollout workers or increasing the resources available to each worker. This can be done by adjusting the `num_rollout_workers` and `num_cpus` parameters in the `RolloutWorker` constructor.\n4. If the issue persists, you can try using the `ray stack` command to dump the stack traces of all Ray workers on the current node, and the `ray timeline` command to dump a timeline visualization of tasks to a file. This can help you identify any performance bottlenecks or other issues that may be causing the deadlock.\n5. If you are using a Tune scheduler, you can try adjusting the `num_workers` and `num_cpus` parameters in the Tune scheduler configuration to ensure that there are enough resources available for the rollout workers.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue causing the rollout workers to deadlock.",

You can also check configured system limits with `ulimit -a` for other resource limit errors. For unexpected hangs or performance problems, you can use `ray stack` to dump the stack traces of all Ray workers on the current node, `ray timeline` to dump a timeline visualization of tasks to a file, and `ray memory` to list all object references in the cluster. If you are developing with TensorFlow, it is recommended to use `framework=tf2` and `eager_tracing=True` for maximum performance and support.

This will allow the workers to read the numpy array in the object store without copying it.\n\nHere's an example:\n```\nimport ray\nimport numpy as np\n\nray.init()\n\n# Create a numpy array\narr = np.ones((100, 100))\n\n# Store the numpy array in the object store\narr_ref = ray.put(arr)\n\n# Pass the object reference to the workers\n@ray.remote\ndef func(arr_ref):\n    # Get the numpy array from the object store\n    arr = ray.get(arr_ref)\n    # Do some computation on the numpy array\n    return arr.sum()\n\n# Call the remote function\nresult = ray.get(func.remote(arr_ref))\n\nprint(result)\n```\nIn this example, the `ray.put()` function is used to store the numpy array `arr` in the object store, and the object reference `arr_ref` is passed to the remote function `func`. The remote function `func` retrieves the numpy array from the object store using `ray.get(arr_ref)`, and then performs some computation on the numpy array. The result of the computation is returned to the driver program using `ray.get(func.remote(arr_ref))`.\n\nNote that the `ray.put()` function is only necessary if you want to store the numpy array in the object store.

            "generated_answer": "  To make a Ray Tune trial retry on failures, you can use the `FailureConfig` class in Ray Tune. This class allows you to configure the behavior of trials when they fail, including the number of retries and the exceptions that should be retried.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `FailureConfig` to enable retries for a trial:\n```\nfrom ray import train, tune\n\n# Define a trainable that implements trial checkpoint saving and loading\ntrainable = train.Trainable(\n    ...\n)\n\n# Configure the failure handling for the trial\nfailure_config = tune.FailureConfig(\n    max_retries=3,  # Retry the trial up to 3 times\n    retry_exceptions=[RuntimeError],  # Retry only on RuntimeError\n)\n\n# Create a trial with the failure config\ntrial = tune.Trial(\n    trainable=trainable,\n    failure_config=failure_config,\n)\n```\nIn this example, the `FailureConfig` class is used to configure the failure handling for the trial. The `max_retries` parameter is set to 3, which means that the trial will be retried up to 3 times if it fails. The `retry_exceptions` parameter is set to `[RuntimeError]`, which means that only `RuntimeError` exceptions will be retried.\n\nWhen a trial fails, Ray Tune will automatically restart it from the latest checkpointed state. If no checkpoint is found, the trial will restart from scratch. You can configure the checkpointing behavior using the `checkpoint_config` parameter in the `Trial` constructor.\n\nNote that the `FailureConfig` class is only available in Ray Tune 1.0 and later. In earlier versions of Ray Tune, you can use the `max_retries` and `retry_exceptions` parameters in the `ray.remote` decorator to configure the failure handling for a trial.",

This function takes in a list of actor handles and performs an all-reduce operation on the data stored in the actors.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `ray.util.collective.allreduce` to perform an all-reduce operation among a list of actors:\n```\nimport ray\nimport cupy\nimport ray.util.collective as col\n\n# Create two actors A and B and create a collective group\nA = Worker.remote()\nB = Worker.remote()\ncol.create_collective_group(A, B)\n\n# Invoke allreduce remotely\nray.get([A.compute.remote(), B.compute.remote()])\n```\nIn this example, `A` and `B` are two actors that have a `compute` method that performs a computation on the data stored in the actor. The `col.create_collective_group` function is used to create a collective group of actors that can communicate with each other. The `ray.get` function is used to invoke the `compute` method on the actors and perform the all-reduce operation.\n\nNote that the `ray.util.collective` module provides a number of other functions for performing collective operations among actors, such as `allgather`, `broadcast`, and `reduce`. These functions can be used in a similar way to perform other types of collective operations.",

The 'apply_reduce' function is used in the reduce phase of the MapReduce process, where the j-th return value from each mapper is sent to the j-th reducer. This is done by passing references to the data using Ray objects, which allows for the handling of large datasets that don\u2019t fit on one machine.

            "generated_answer": "  To add logs inside an actor in Ray, you can use the `logging` module in Python. Here's an example:\n```\nimport ray\nimport logging\n\n@ray.remote\nclass MyActor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n    def foo(self):\n        self.logger.info(\"Hello from MyActor!\")\n```\nIn this example, we define a `MyActor` class with a `foo` method that logs a message using the `info` level. The `logging` module is imported and used to create a logger for the actor. The `__init__` method is used to initialize the logger.\n\nYou can also customize the prefix for Actor logs by defining the `__repr__` method for the Actor class. This method returns a string representation of the Actor that can be used to distinguish between different Actors. For example:\n```\nimport ray\nimport logging\n\n@ray.remote\nclass MyActor:\n    def __init__(self, index):\n        self.index = index\n        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n    def foo(self):\n        self.logger.info(\"Hello from MyActor!\")\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"MyActor(index={self.index})\"\n```\nIn this example, we define a `MyActor` class with a `foo` method that logs a message using the `info` level. The `__init__` method is used to initialize the logger and the `index` attribute is used to create a unique prefix for the Actor logs. The `__repr__` method is used to create a string representation of the Actor that includes the `index` attribute.",

If you specify a local directory, the contents of the directory will be directly accessed as the working directory. If you specify a remote URI, the contents of the zip file will be directly accessed as the working directory.\n\nTo specify multiple working directories, you can use the `working_dir` key in the runtime environment dictionary and provide a list of directories or URIs as the value. For example:\n```\nruntime_env = {\n    \"working_dir\": [\"/some_path/example_dir\", \"/some_other_path/example_dir\"]\n}\n```\nAlternatively, you can use the `working_dir` key with a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary specifies a single working directory and its corresponding remote URI.

            "question": "how to create an actor instance with parameter?",
            "generated_answer": "  To create an actor instance with parameters in Ray, you can use the `ActorClass.remote()` method and pass the parameters as arguments to the constructor. For example:\n```\n# Define the Counter actor.\n@ray.remote\nclass Counter:\n    def __init__(self, initial_value):\n        self.i = initial_value\n\n    def get(self):\n        return self.i\n\n    def incr(self, value):\n        self.i += value\n\n# Create a Counter actor with an initial value of 10.\ncounter = Counter.remote(10)\n```\nIn this example, the `Counter` actor is defined with a constructor that takes an initial value as a parameter. When we create an instance of the `Counter` actor using `Counter.remote(10)`, Ray will start a remote instance of the `Counter` actor with an initial value of 10.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.actor` function to create actors from regular Java classes. For example:\n```\n// A regular Java class.\npublic class Counter {\n\n    private int value = 0;\n\n    public int increment() {\n        this.value += 1;\n        return this.value;\n    }\n}\n\n// Create an actor from this class.\n// `ray.actor` takes a factory method that can produce\n// a `Counter` object. Here, we pass `Counter`'s constructor\n// as the argument.\nActorHandle<Counter> counter = ray.actor(Counter::new).remote();\n```\nIn this example, the `Counter` class is defined with a constructor that takes no arguments. When we create an instance of the `Counter` actor using `ray.actor(Counter::new).remote()`, Ray will start a remote instance of the `Counter` actor with a default value of 0.\n\nYou can also use the `ray::Actor` function to create actors from regular C++ classes. For example:\n```\n// A regular C++ class.\nclass Counter {\n\nprivate:\n    int value = 0;\n\npublic:\n    int increment() {\n        this->value += 1;\n        return this->value;\n    }\n};\n\n// Create an actor from this class.\n// `ray::Actor` takes a factory method that can produce\n// a `Counter` object. Here, we pass `Counter`'s constructor\n// as the argument.\nActorHandle<Counter> counter = ray::Actor(CreateCounter).remote();\n```\nIn this example, the `Counter` class is defined with a constructor that takes no arguments. When we create an instance of the `Counter` actor using `ray::Actor(CreateCounter).remote()`, Ray will start a remote instance of the `Counter` actor with a default value of 0.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.getActor` function to retrieve an actor instance by its name. For example:\n```\n// Create an actor with a name.\nActorHandle<Counter> counter = ray.actor(Counter::new).setName(\"some_name\").remote();\n\n...\n\n// Retrieve the actor later somewhere\nOptional<ActorHandle<Counter>> counter = ray.getActor(\"some_name\");\nAssert.assertTrue(counter.isPresent());\n```\nIn this example, we create an instance of the `Counter` actor with a name of \"some_name\". Later, we can retrieve the actor instance using `ray.getActor(\"some_name\")`. If the actor instance exists, `ray.getActor` will return an `Optional` containing the actor handle. If the actor instance does not exist, `ray.getActor` will return an empty `Optional`.",
            "reference_answer": "To create an actor instance with a parameter, you can modify the constructor of the actor class to accept parameters. For example, in Python, you can modify the Counter class like this:\\n\\n@ray.remote\\nclass Counter:\\n    def __init__(self, start_value):\\n        self.value = start_value\\n\\n    def increment(self):\\n        self.value += 1\\n        return self.value\\n\\n    def get_counter(self):\\n        return self.value\\n\\n# Create an actor from this class with a start value of 5.\\ncounter = Counter.remote(5)\\n\\nThis will create an instance of the Counter actor with a starting value of 5.

If there are pending nodes, you can use the `kubectl describe` command to get more information about the pending nodes and any errors that may have occurred. For example, you can run `kubectl describe rayservice rayservice-sample` to get more information about the pending nodes in the `rayservice-sample` Ray cluster.\n3. If the issue persists, you can try restarting the Ray cluster using the `--restart-only` flag. This will restart the Ray cluster without running any of the installation commands. For example, you can run `ray up CLUSTER.YAML --restart-only` to restart the `CLUSTER.YAML` Ray cluster.\n4. If the issue still persists, you can try increasing the size of the Ray pods or adding more nodes to the Ray cluster.

            "generated_answer": "  To get more detailed errors or logs from Ray Serve, you can use the following methods:\n\n1. Check the Kuberay operator logs by running `kubectl logs -f <kuberay-operator-pod-name>` (e.g., `kubectl logs -f kuberay-operator-7447d85d58-lv7pf`). The Kuberay operator logs contain information about the Serve application deployment event and Serve application health checks.\n2. Check the controller log and deployment log, which are located under `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/` in both the head node pod and worker node pod. These logs contain information about specific deployment failure reasons and autoscaling events.\n3. Use the Ray Dashboard to get a high-level overview of your Ray Cluster and Ray Serve application\u2019s states. The Ray Dashboard is available both during local testing and on a remote cluster in production. Ray Serve provides some in-built metrics and logging as well as utilities for adding custom metrics and logs in your application. For production deployments, exporting logs and metrics to your observability platforms is recommended. See Monitoring for more details.\n4. Use the Python logging module with a logger named \"ray.serve\" to log detailed information about the internal state of the Ray Serve application. This can help you understand system-level behavior and surface application-level details during runtime. By default, logs are emitted from actors both to stderr and on disk on each node at `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/`.",

Ray Dashboard: You can use the Ray Dashboard to get a high-level overview of your Ray cluster and Ray Serve application's states. The dashboard provides details such as the number of deployment replicas currently running, logs for your Serve controller, deployment replicas, and proxies, and the Ray nodes (i.e. machines) running in your Ray cluster.\n2. Ray logging: Ray Serve uses Python's standard logging module with a logger named \"ray.serve\". By default, logs are emitted from actors both to stderr and on disk on each node at /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/. This includes both system-level logs from the Serve controller and proxy as well as access logs and custom user logs produced from within deployment replicas.\n3. Post-mortem debugging: You can automatically drop into the debugger when an error occurs or an exception is thrown. To do this, install the required dependencies (pip install \"ray[serve]\" scikit-learn) and set the env var RAY_PDB=1. When the serve_debugging.py driver hits the breakpoint, it will tell you to run ray debug.\n4. Memray: If you notice a memory leak on a Serve actor, you can use memray to debug. Set the env var RAY_SERVE_ENABLE_MEMORY_PROFILING=1, and run your Serve application. All the Serve actors will run a memray tracker that logs their memory usage to bin files in the /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/ directory. Run the memray flamegraph [bin file] command to generate a flamegraph of the memory usage.\n5. Runtime environments: You can use runtime environments to track uncaught exceptions in Ray Serve.",

The actor is created with 0 CPUs and only occupies 0 CPUs after creation. This is because the Ray actor is designed to be lightweight and does not require a lot of CPU resources.\n\nIn the context provided, the Ray actor is used for data processing and the data processing tasks are not CPU-intensive. Therefore, the actor does not require a lot of CPU resources to complete the tasks.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Ray actor is designed to be highly parallelizable, which means that it can take advantage of multiple CPU cores to complete tasks more quickly. However, in this case, the tasks are not CPU-intensive, so the actor does not require a lot of CPU resources.",
            "reference_answer": "Your Ray tuner might be showing 'running' but CPU usage is almost 0% due to several reasons. It could be because the number of cores Ray is using is less than the tasks it needs to perform. It could also be due to the tasks being very small or having variable durations. Another reason could be that all of your tasks are attempting to use all of the cores on the machine, leading to contention and preventing your application from achieving a speedup. This is common with some versions of numpy. To avoid contention, set an environment variable like MKL_NUM_THREADS to 1.",

The object store memory is used when your application creates objects in the object store via `ray.put` and when it returns values from remote functions.

The size of the object store can be controlled by `--object-store-memory`.

            "generated_answer": "  The reasons for spikes in node CPU utilization in a Ray cluster include:\n\n1. Insufficient resources: If the cluster is not provisioned with enough resources, such as CPU or memory, tasks may be queued or delayed, leading to spikes in CPU utilization.\n2. Preprocessing compute time: If the preprocessing step of the tasks is computationally intensive, adding more CPU-only nodes can help parallelize the preprocessing and reduce CPU utilization.\n3. GPU utilization rate: If the GPU utilization rate is low, it may indicate that the tasks are not being parallelized effectively, leading to spikes in CPU utilization.\n4. Memory usage: If the memory usage of the cluster is high, it may cause the node to run low on memory, leading to spikes in CPU utilization as the node tries to free up memory.\n5. System overload: If the system is highly overloaded or stressed, it may cause the node to crash or shut down, leading to spikes in CPU utilization.\n6. Linux Out of Memory killer: If the Linux Out of Memory killer is triggered, it may kill processes with high memory usage, leading to spikes in CPU utilization.\n7. Ray Memory Monitor: If the Ray Memory Monitor is triggered, it may kill processes with high memory usage, leading to spikes in CPU utilization.",
            "reference_answer": "Spikes in node CPU utilization can occur due to the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node. By default, Ray tasks require 1 CPU each and Ray actors require 0 CPU each, so the scheduler limits task concurrency to the available CPUs and actor concurrency to infinite. Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones. Tasks or actors that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM. To manage this, the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node can be reduced by increasing the amount of resources requested by them.",

Use the `ray.put()` method to put large objects in the Ray object store, and then pass object references as arguments to the remote functions or classes.\n2. Configure the directory where objects are spilled to using the `object_spilling_config` parameter in the `_system_config` dictionary.\n3. Use multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed.\n4. Avoid closure capturing large objects in remote functions or classes, use object store instead.\n5. Use NVMe SSDs (or other high performance storage) if possible.",
            "reference_answer": "To avoid objects not getting spilled in Ray, you can configure the directory where objects are spilled to. You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open). It is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. Spilling to multiple remote storages is also supported.",

It allows you to turn your functions and classes into Ray tasks and actors, and work with Ray objects. You can run functions as remote tasks in the cluster by decorating your function with @ray.remote and calling the function with .remote(). Ray also provides actors to parallelize computation across multiple actor instances. When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance of that class in the cluster. This actor can then execute remote method calls and maintain its own internal state. Ray stores task and actor call results in its distributed object store, returning object references that can be later retrieved.",
