            "generated_answer": "  To specify ScalingConfig for a Tuner run, you can use the `tune.with_resources` function and pass in the `train_fn` and `resources` arguments. The `resources` argument should be a `ScalingConfig` object that specifies the resource requirements for the training function.\n\nHere is an example:\n```\ntuner = tune.Tuner(\n    tune.with_resources(\n        train_fn,\n        resources=ScalingConfig(\n            num_cpus=2,\n            num_gpus=1,\n            memory=1024,\n        ),\n    ),\n    run_config=run_config,\n)\n```\nIn this example, the `ScalingConfig` object specifies that the training function should be run on a machine with 2 CPUs, 1 GPU, and 1024 MB of memory.\n\nAlternatively, you can create a `ScalingConfig` object from a Tune's `PlacementGroupFactory` and pass it to the `tune.with_resources` function. This can be useful if you want to specify the resource requirements for multiple training functions at once.\n\nHere is an example:\n```\nplacement_group_factory = tune.PlacementGroupFactory(\n    num_cpus=2,\n    num_gpus=1,\n    memory=1024,\n)\n\ntuner = tune.Tuner(\n    tune.with_resources(\n        train_fn,\n        resources=placement_group_factory.create_scaling_config(),\n    ),\n    run_config=run_config,\n)\n```\nIn this example, the `PlacementGroupFactory` object specifies the resource requirements for the training function, and the `create_scaling_config` method creates a `ScalingConfig` object from the `PlacementGroupFactory` object. The `ScalingConfig` object is then passed to the `tune.with_resources` function to specify the resource requirements for the training function.",

This class allows you to configure the failure handling of individual trials, including the number of retries and the delay between retries.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `FailureConfig` to retry a trial up to 3 times with a 10-second delay between retries:\n```\nfrom ray.tune import FailureConfig\n\n# Define the failure configuration\nfailure_config = FailureConfig(\n    max_retries=3,\n    retry_delay=10,\n)\n\n# Create a new trial with the failure configuration\ntrial = Trial(\n    name=\"my_trial\",\n    failure_config=failure_config,\n)\n```\nIn this example, the `FailureConfig` class is used to define the failure configuration for the trial. The `max_retries` parameter is set to 3, which means that the trial will be retried up to 3 times if it fails. The `retry_delay` parameter is set to 10, which means that there will be a 10-second delay between retries.\n\nOnce the trial is created with the failure configuration, it will be retried up to 3 times if it fails. If the trial still fails after the maximum number of retries, it will be marked as failed and will not be retried again.",

Use the Kubernetes command-line tool (kubectl) to create the Ray cluster. You can do this by running the command `kubectl create -f <config-file>` where `<config-file>` is the name of the Kubernetes config file you created in step 1.\n3. Once the Ray cluster is created, you can use the Kubernetes dashboard to monitor and manage the cluster. You can also use the `kubectl` command-line tool to interact with the cluster, such as scaling the number of nodes or updating the cluster configuration.\n4. To manage Ray Serve applications on the Ray cluster, you can use the `ray serve` command-line tool.

For sidecar containers, you can process logs by configuring a log-processing sidecar for each Ray pod.

By default, Ray tasks require 1 CPU each and Ray actors require 0 CPU each, so the scheduler limits task concurrency to the available CPUs and actor concurrency to infinite. Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones. Tasks or actors that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM. To manage this, the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node can be reduced by increasing the amount of resources requested by them.",

Additionally, you can disable object spilling by setting the `automatic_object_spilling` parameter to `False`.",
            "reference_answer": "To avoid objects not getting spilled in Ray, you can configure the directory where objects are spilled to. You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open). It is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. Spilling to multiple remote storages is also supported.",

It allows you to turn your functions and classes into Ray tasks and actors, and work with Ray objects. You can run functions as remote tasks in the cluster by decorating your function with @ray.remote and calling the function with .remote(). Ray also provides actors to parallelize computation across multiple actor instances. When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance of that class in the cluster. This actor can then execute remote method calls and maintain its own internal state.
