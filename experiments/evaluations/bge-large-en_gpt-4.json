The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider.

It is built on top of Ray, so it easily scales to many machines and offers flexible scheduling support such as fractional GPUs so you can share resources and serve many machine learning models at low cost.

Serve then applies it to all running and future deployment replicas. The application of user configuration does not restart the replica. This means you can use this field to dynamically adjust model weights and versions without restarting the cluster, adjust traffic splitting percentage for your model composition graph, configure any feature flag, A/B tests, and hyper-parameters for your deployments. To enable the user_config feature, you need to implement a reconfigure method that takes a JSON-serializable object (e.g., a Dictionary, List or String) as its only argument. If the user_config is set when the deployment is created (e.g., in the decorator or the Serve config file), this reconfigure method is called right after the deployment\u2019s __init__ method, and the user_config is passed in as an argument.

Check the output of `ray status` command to view the status of your cluster and see if there are any errors or failures reported.\n2. Look for any recent failures in the cluster status output.\n3. Verify that the expected number of nodes have joined the cluster. You can use the `wait_for_nodes` function provided in the code snippet to wait for all nodes to join the cluster.\n4. If the cluster seems to be in a bad state, you can try restarting it using `ray up`. This will restart all Ray services even if there are no config changes.\n5. If the head node is out of date from the specified YAML, it may need to be terminated and replaced with a new node. Setup commands and file mounts will be reapplied in this case.\n\nAdditionally, you can check the logs in `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/monitor.*` to view the autoscaler monitor log for more information about the cluster status.\n\nNote: The warning message about the cluster not having any available CPUs suggests that there may be resource constraints causing the pending nodes.

You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open).

Ray also provides actors to parallelize computation across multiple actor instances. When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance of that class in the cluster.
