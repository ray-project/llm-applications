The Ray autoscaler, which runs on the head node or as a sidecar container in the head pod in Kubernetes, adjusts the number of worker nodes in the cluster based on the resource demands of the Ray workload. The autoscaler reacts to task and actor resource requests, not application metrics or physical resource utilization. The Ray Serve autoscaler asks Ray to start replica actors based on request demand, and if there aren't enough available CPUs, it requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas. This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The parameters include min_replicas, initial_replicas, max_replicas, and target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it tries to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

It has a streaming paradigm and is commonly used for big data processing. Spark can also be used on Ray through the RayDP library, which combines Spark and Ray clusters to enable large-scale data processing using the PySpark API.\n\nIn terms of performance, Dask-on-Ray is an ongoing project and may not achieve the same performance as using Ray directly.

It is built on top of Ray, so it easily scales to many machines and offers flexible scheduling support such as fractional GPUs so you can share resources and serve many machine learning models at low cost.

You can specify the number of CPUs you want to be available using the num_cpus parameter, or you can specify a set of resource shapes using the bundles parameter. For example, to request 1000 CPUs, you would use the command request_resources(num_cpus=1000).

Adjusting the max file descriptors limit per process using the ulimit command can help resolve this issue.

Check if the Kubernetes cluster has enough resources to accommodate the Ray application. Insufficient resources can cause the cluster to continuously restart, leading to a loop of restarts.\n\n2. If your program freezes, you can restart the Ray cluster without running any installation commands using the command: `$ ray up CLUSTER.YAML --restart-only`.\n\n3. Wait for a while until all nodes have started. You can use the command `ray kill-random-node tune-default.yaml --hard` to force the trials to continue on a different worker node.\n\n4. If the pods are stuck in the Pending state, check for errors using `kubectl describe pod raycluster-kuberay-xxxx-xxxxx` and ensure that your Docker resource limits are set high enough.\n\n5. To view the status of your cluster, use the command `ray status`. You can also check the autoscaler monitor log by running `cat /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/monitor.*`.\n\n6. If you are running a large Ray cluster with more than 1k nodes, you may need to tune system settings to enable communication between the machines. Check the logs of the head node using `kubectl logs ${RAYCLUSTER_HEAD_POD}`.\n\n7. Start the head node using the command `ray start --head --port=6379`. The command will provide the Ray cluster address, which can be used to start worker nodes on other machines.\n\nMake sure to check the specific error messages and logs for more detailed information about the issue.",

This includes system-level logs from the Serve controller and proxy as well as access logs and custom user logs produced from within deployment replicas. You can parse these stored logs with a logging stack such as ELK or Loki to be able to search by deployment or replica.

There are two types of smoothing factors: `upscale_smoothing_factor` and `downscale_smoothing_factor`. The `upscale_smoothing_factor` can be increased to scale up resources quickly when there is high traffic volume in a short period of time. On the other hand, the `downscale_smoothing_factor` can be decreased to slow down the pace of downscaling, making the application less sensitive to drops in traffic.",
