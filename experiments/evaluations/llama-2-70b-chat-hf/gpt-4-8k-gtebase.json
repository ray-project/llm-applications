For instance, in the provided example, `increase_brightness` function increases the brightness of an image. Similarly, if you're dealing with pandas DataFrame, you can perform operations like dropping NaN values from the DataFrame using your function.

            "generated_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by automatically adjusting the number of deployment replicas depending on the load, meaning the user traffic. This autoscaling feature is managed by the Ray Serve Autoscaler, which is an application-level autoscaler placed on top of the Ray Autoscaler. This setup means that the Ray Serve Autoscaler commands Ray to start a certain number of replica actors as per the request demand. \n\nImportantly, this feature enables the application to efficiently cater to user traffic without squandering resources. Ray Serve Autoscaler, running on the head node or as a sidecar container in the head pod (in case of using Kubernetes), is specifically designed to accommodate resource demands that exceed the existing capacity. Along with this, Ray Serve also supports features like batching, model optimization techniques, and streaming responses to further improve the application's performance.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in Ray Serve works with the help of a demand-based replica autoscaler which responds to traffic spikes by evaluating the size of the queue and determining whether more or less replicas are needed. This can be configured by setting the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The 'min_replicas' and 'max_replicas' fields determine the range of replicas that can be deployed, with deployments starting with 'initial_replicas'. The 'target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica' configures how aggressively the autoscaler responds to traffic. The Ray Serve Autoscaler uses the Ray Autoscaler, and the number of replica actors based on the request demand are started by ray. If there's not enough CPUs to support these actors, Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the cloud provider, which can add more nodes. Similarly, when Ray Serve scales down and ends some replica actors, it attempts to do so in a manner which results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, in which case, the Ray Autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

If you use AsyncIO's await to wait for a Ray future like `await x.remote()`, it will issue a warning if it's running inside an async context.\n\nHowever, there are several workarounds to this. You can wrap the async function with a wrapper to run the task synchronously. \n\nAnother method is to use `await asyncio.wait([some_task.remote()])` instead of `ray.wait(object_refs)`. This allows you to increase concurrency by using async APIs. \n\nLastly, the result of `handle.remote()` can be passed directly as an argument to other downstream handles, without having to await on it. \n\nHere is an example of how you can use `await some_task.remote()` and `await asyncio.wait([some_task.remote()])`:\n\n```\nimport ray\nimport asyncio\n\n@ray.remote\ndef some_task():\n  return 1\n\nasync def await_obj_ref():\n  await some_task.remote()\n  await asyncio.wait([some_task.remote()])\n\nasyncio.run(await_obj_ref())\n```\n\nIn the above code, the function `some_task` is defined with the `@ray.remote` decorator to run the task asynchronously. The function `await_obj_ref` awaits the result of `some_task` and also demonstrates how to use `asyncio.wait()` to wait for the task to complete.

It offers tools such as SQL, DataFrames and MLLib for data processing and machine learning tasks. RayDP (also known as \"Spark on Ray\") allows users to easily use Spark inside a Ray program for tasks such as reading input data, processing data, extracting and transforming features. This combination provides the flexibility of Ray with the power of Spark.\n\nRay, on the other hand, offers features such as launching cloud clusters and shared-memory stores. It is used for a variety of tasks, from simple parallelism to distributed deep learning. In addition to that, you can also use Dask on Ray to scale analytics and scientific computing workloads. \n\nDask is a Python parallel computing library. It provides big data collections that mimic the APIs of familiar libraries such as NumPy and Pandas. This feature makes it relatively easy for Python users to adopt Dask. Usage of Dask on Ray takes advantage of Ray-specific features, allowing for a more seamless integration in analytics workloads. \n\nIn terms of performance, it's mentioned that there's a comparison between Ray Data and Apache Spark as well as SageMaker. However, the details are not provided in the context. It would be advisable to refer to the referenced comparison for more detailed information on how they perform relative to one another in specific use-cases. \n\nIn summary, each of these tools has its strengths and usage would depend on the specific requirements of the project.

            "generated_answer": "Ray Serve offers several advantages over Modal, Seldon, or utilizing containers directly for deploying machine learning models. One main advantage is its ability to support multi-model composition using a programmable API where calls to different models are as simple as function calls. This feature can reduce complexity and improve efficiency in your machine learning pipeline. One potential issue with using standard containers is that they can be limiting and more difficult to work with, especially when it comes to calls to different models. These difficulties can be mitigated by using a service like Ray Serve, whose API is user-friendly and intuitive, and also provides comprehensive reference documentation for assistance.",
            "reference_answer": "Ray Serve provides several advantages for serving ML models over traditional methods such as using Modal, Seldon, or deploying models in containers directly. These include the ability to serve any type of ML model, regardless of the underlying ML framework it's built with. Moreover, Ray Serve also offers features such as dynamic request batching, support for serving models across multiple nodes and GPUs, and resource scheduling capabilities like fractional GPUs, enabling low-cost serving of multiple ML models. On top of these, Ray Serve is particularly effective for model composition and multi-model serving, as it allows you to build complex inference services involving multiple ML models and business logic, all written in Python. Unlike other systems that require static graphs to be defined in configuration languages, Ray Serve uses a programmable API for multi-model composition, making it easier to work with and more flexible. Lastly, Ray Serve also offers automatic scaling of resources based on load and support for efficient vectorized operations via request batching, helping optimize your serving costs.",

This is indicated by '10 Workers (tasks / actors) killed due to memory pressure (OOM)'. \n   \n2. **Memory Management**: Tensorflow typically reserves all available GPU memory for itself which can often lead to OOM issues.

If application tasks or actors consume a large amount of heap space, it can cause the node to run out of memory. When that happens, the operating system starts killing worker or raylet processes, disrupting the application. This could stall metrics and if it happens on the head node, stall the dashboard or other control processes, causing the cluster to become unusable. Ray provides a memory monitor to prevent OOM issues by periodic checking of memory usage and killing tasks or actor processes to free up memory when the combined usage exceeds a configurable threshold. However, if an application has tasks that use more memory than available and are set to infinite retry, the worker kill policy could fail and result in OOM error, leading to node death.",

You can do this by using the `get_objects` method, which gets the values in the object store associated with the IDs. Here, `object_refs` is a list of the references you want to retrieve and `timeout` is an optional float value that specifies the amount of time to wait before giving up.\n\nTo call the `get_objects` method with a list of object refs, you may use the following code snippet:\n\n```python\ndef get_objects(self, object_refs: list, timeout: Optional[float] = None):\n    ...\nreturn object_refs[0]\n```\n\nIn the case where there is more than one object ref, you can retrieve them using:\n\n```python\nreturn object_refs\n```\n\nEssentially, object refs are like pointers or unique IDs that can refer to a remote object without seeing its value. They can also be created in different ways. The return type of the method is `ObjectRef` which is the object ref that the object was put under.\nIn case you need to return a specific type `R`, you may overload the `get` function like this:\n\n```python\n@overload\ndef get(object_refs: \"ObjectRef[R]\", *, timeout: Optional[float] = None) -> R:\n    ...\n```",

The 'zero-copy' can be used as a parameter while calling `map_batches()` or `.to_numpy_refs()` function.

Here is an example:\n\n```python\nray.data.range(10, parallelism=2).to_numpy_refs(zero_copy_batch=True)\n```\n\n3. If your function 'fn' doesn't mutate its input, you can also set `zero_copy_batch=True` to improve performance and decrease memory utilization:\n\n```python\nzero_copy_batch=True\n```\n\n4. This provides zero-copy access to the underlying data. For accessing data, you can use `.to_arrow()` or `.get_internal_block_refs()` functions:\n\n```python\nds.to_arrow()\nds.get_internal_block_refs()\n```\n\n5.

Configure the RunConfig to specify where the checkpoints will be stored and what will be used to determine the best checkpoint (in your case, the mean_accuracy):\n```python\nrun_config=air.RunConfig(\n        name=exp_name,\n        stop={\"training_iteration\": 100},\n        checkpoint_config=air.CheckpointConfig(\n            checkpoint_score_attribute=\"mean_accuracy\",\n            num_to_keep=5,\n        ),\n        storage_path=storage_path,\n    )\n```\n2. After the training is finished, LightningTrainer saves AIR checkpoints in the result directory (in your case, `storage_path`). The file paths will have the format `\"LightningTrainer_.*/checkpoint_000000\"`.\n\nYou can retrieve the best checkpoint using Python's file and directory management libraries. For example, you can use `glob` or `os` to locate all saved checkpoints, and then parse the filenames to find the checkpoint with the highest accuracy:\n\n```python\nimport glob\nimport re\n\n# Get all checkpoint files\nckt_files = glob.glob(f\"{storage_path}/LightningTrainer_*/checkpoint_*\")\n\n# Extract accuracy from each filename\naccuracies = [float(re.search(\"checkpoint_(.*)\", f).group(1)) for f in ckt_files]\n\n# Find the filename with the highest accuracy\nbest_checkpoint_file = ckt_files[accuracies.index(max(accuracies))]\n```\n\nNote that the exact code may vary depending on the exact structure of your filenames and directories. This is just a general example.",

This method retrieves the best checkpoint from a trial based on a specific metric. It accepts two parameters: 'metric' and 'mode'. 'Metric' refers to the specific measurement or standard that you want to use to order the checkpoints, while 'mode' should be either 'min' or 'max', depending on whether you want to retrieve the checkpoint with the minimum or maximum metric value.

Efficiency: The actor-based approach can lead to better efficiency since it reuses model initialization for many tasks. This means the node will spend more time on actual workload.\n\n2. Concurrency: The singleton actor can use threaded actors to achieve concurrency.\n\n3. Isolated State Management: By using the actor instance's variables to capture global state, the problem of managing state between multiple class instances is avoided. \n\nThe disadvantage of using a singleton actor is:\n\n1. Unique Process per Instance: Each actor instance is instantiated in its own process. This means each actor will have its own copy of the class variables, which can lead to higher memory usage and potential consistency issues.",
            "reference_answer": "The advantages of using singleton Actor are: 1) It allows retrieving the actor from any job in the Ray cluster, 2) It is useful when you cannot directly pass the actor handle to the task that needs it, or when trying to access an actor launched by another driver, 3) Actors can be named and scoped by namespace which allows different namespaces to have actors with the same name, 4) It provides functionality to 'get-or-create' a named actor which can create an actor if it doesn't exist, 5) Actor lifetimes can be decoupled from the job, allowing an actor to persist even after the job exits. The downside or disadvantages of singleton actors are: 1) It can lead to difficulties in managing state as the object is shared through different clients, 2) Named actors will be garbage collected if no handles to it exist, 3) There can be issues with certain features in different programming languages. For example, 'get-if-exists' and actor lifetime customization may not be available in all languages like Java and C++, 4) Detached actors are not automatically garbage collected.

Flexibility: If it is not possible to pass the actor handle directly to the task that requires it, using a named actor is a practical alternative.\n4. Control over Actor Lifetimes: You can choose to detach an actor for it to be accessible as long as needed, or keep it attached to the original driver's lifetime by only specifying the name, which can provide better control over the lifecycle of actors based on the specific requirements of your operation.\n5.

Named actors are particularly useful in cases where you need to create an actor only if it doesn't already exist, as demonstrated by the get_if_exists option during actor creation.\n4.

'Rollout_fragment_length' sets the number of steps to be taken in each episode, while 'batch_mode' can be set to either 'truncate_episodes' or 'complete_episodes' based on how you want to handle episodes that exceed your configured rollout length.\n\nIt's important to note that you should exercise caution when setting 'batch_mode' to 'complete_episodes'. If your environment doesn't terminate naturally or readily, this configuration could result in exceptionally large batch sizes. For that reason, your 'batch_mode' should match the characteristics and requirements of your environment.",

The most common reason for this error message is when the actor's definition captures a large object or array. You have to check whether any large objects or arrays are being captured within the scope of the actor's definition.\n\n2. Use `ray.put()` method to store the large objects in the Ray's object store. This is useful as it helps to reduce the size of the object that is being captured.\n\n3. The warning message suggests you have an actor pool of size 4 but you've configured a batch size of 720. Consider reducing the batch size to ensure full parallelization across your actor pool. It's suggested the batch size should not exceed 360 in your case.\n\n4. If you're working with a data loader and encountering a similar error, consider moving the data loader to inside the training function. This can often help in reducing the size of the actor.\n\nRemember, your aim is always to reduce the number of large objects that are being implicitly captured in scope during the execution of your actor's code.\n\nIt's also always good to validate your code to ensure there are no TypeErrors or instances of classes not behaving as they should. In the context provided, there's a warning about inheriting from an `ActorClass`, which should be addressed if it's part of the code throwing your `ValueError`.",

Instead, you can use the Ray object store. Two approaches can be used to avoid this problem: \\n\\n1.

            "generated_answer": "To distribute training for your custom neural net written using Keras in Databricks using Ray, you will do the following:\n\n1. First, make sure you import and initialize Ray. If you're using additional packages, consider setting them up within a runtime environment. For instance:\n\n   ```python\n   import ray\n\n   ray.init(\n       runtime_env={\n           \"pip\": [\n               \"datasets\",\n               \"evaluate\",\n               \"transformers>=4.26.0\",\n               \"torch>=1.12.0\",\n               \"pytorch_lightning>=2.0\",\n           ]\n       }\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. Use vanilla Keras for non-distributed training scenarios. If your dataset is relatively small and there are many trials (e.g., many hyperparameter configurations), you can use a Ray tune callback with Tensorflow/Keras to parallelize model training.\n\n3. Create an Iterator[ray.data.Dataset] abstraction to represent a stream of data for incremental training. This abstraction is useful for large models that don't fit in GPU memory. Implement a custom Ray Actor-based data preprocessor to preprocess your dataset which will allow for incrementally training a model using data parallel training.\n\n4. When working with custom Keras models in RLlib, you may have to customize model training and preprocessor code. Consider using resources such as the \"Getting Started with RLlib\" tutorial or the \"Deep reinforcement learning at Riot Games\" video for help.\n\n5. To run distributed training of a TensorFlow model with Ray, use the following example as a guide:\n\n   ```python\n   import argparse\n   from filelock import FileLock\n   import json\n   import os\n   \n   # Insert your TensorFlow model code here\n   ```\n   \n   This example showcases how to use TensorFlow with Ray. For further details about this, refer to the example shared on the TensorFlow website in the tutorial 'multi_worker_with_keras'.\n\nRemember that Ray can be used for parallelizing, distributing as well as managing your computation. So consider carefully how you deploy your model when using Ray.\n",

It contains a function `train_tensorflow_mnist()` to start the training with given parameters and a script at the end to take arguments from the command line and initiate the model training. \\n\\nTo use this code for your custom neural network, you'll need to replace the `build_cnn_model()` function with your custom neural network model.\\n\\nHere is an overview of the steps:\\n\\n1. Create your custom model function to replace `build_cnn_model()`.\\n2. Pass your global batch size to your dataset function, which is `mnist_dataset()` in this script. \\n3. The script already predefined a TensorFlow distribution strategy (`tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy()`) which takes care of the distribution of your model across multiple workers. It is used within the `train_func()`.\\n4. The main function `train_tensorflow_mnist()` initiates a `TensorflowTrainer` with the given parameters (including the `train_func()` you defined before which contains your model and the distribution strategy). \\n5. The `fit()` function is then called on the trainer object to start the training.\\n\\nTo run this on Databricks use the Databricks's CLI with the command `databricks python run`, and use command-line arguments to adjust parameters like number of workers, to use GPU or not, and the number of epochs.\\n\\nRemember to first set up the Ray and Databricks environment before running your script.",

The function `ray.get()` is used when you wish to fetch values that have been stored using `ray.put()` or that have been computed by a task or actor. To make use of it:\n\n```python\nready_refs = ray.get(a)\n```\n\nIn this code, `ray.get(a)` will fetch from the object store the value or object corresponding to the stored ID `a`.\n\nA practical example involving both functions would be:\n\n```python\na = ray.put(None) # Store a value and return its ID\nb = f.remote([a]) # Example task or actor that requires stored value ID as an argument\nray.get(b) # Fetch the value or object computed by task or actor\n```\n\nThis will store the `None` value, pass its object ID to a remote function or actor `f`, and then retrieve the returned value or object from the task or actor. \n\nJust remember to use the `.remote()` call to execute actor methods or tasks on your Ray cluster and as the mean to instantiate these actors.",

Create your actors, for example you may create them remotely: \n```python\na1, a2 = Actor.remote(), Actor.remote()\n```\n\n2. Next, create an ActorPool and add your actors to this pool:\n```python\npool = ActorPool([a1, a2])\n```\n\n3. If required, you may dynamically add or remove actors from the pool. For instance, to add Actor a2 to the pool, use the push method:\n```python\npool.push(a2)\n```\n\n4. If you need to re-distribute work among the actors (for instance, if the number of actors has changed), use a re-partition function:\n```python\nself._repartition_datasets_to_match_num_actors()\n```\n\n5. To execute the all_reduce operation, use the `allreduce` method from Torch library. Specify the tensor list that you want to reduce and the reduce operation that should be applied:\n```python\nopts.reduceOp = op\ng.allreduce(tensor_list, opts)\n```\n\n6. If you need custom reduction functionality, you may define a `reduce_fn`. This function consumes the results of the actors and reduces them into a single result.

Import the 'ray' module, and any other necessary modules:\n\n```python\nimport ray\nimport unittest\n```\n\n2. Define a function decorated with '@ray.remote' to create a remote task:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote\ndef f(a, b, c):\n    return a + b + c\n```\n\n3. Spawn the remote task and retrieve the result using 'ray.get()':\n\n```python\nobject_ref = f.remote(1, 2, 3)\nresult = ray.get(object_ref)\n```\n\n4. For the unit test, you will need to use an assertion to check the expected result. This could be something like:\n\n```python\nassert result == (1 + 2 + 3)\n```\n\n5. Remember to initialize the Ray environment with 'ray.init()':\n\n```python\nray.init()\n```\n\n6. Document your code as thoroughly as possible, especially public functions. This helps in code maintenance and usage by other developers.\n\nHere is a simple example of how a unit test might look:\n\n```python\nclass TestRay(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_remote_addition(self):\n        ray.init()\n\n        @ray.remote\n        def f(a, b, c):\n            return a + b + c\n\n        object_ref = f.remote(1, 2, 3)\n        result = ray.get(object_ref)\n        self.assertEqual(result, 1 + 2 + 3)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nYour unit test code should be placed in the corresponding file in the 'ray/python/ray/tests/' directory.\n\nBefore finalising your work, go over any feedback you get during the code review process and make necessary changes. \n\nAnd finally, check 'doc/README.md' for instructions on creating and modifying public documentation.\n\nRemember, the unit test is just for testing a single function or piece of code. Other types of tests may be required for larger pieces of functionality or integrated systems.",

Import the necessary modules: ray and others if required.\n\n2. Set the pip version in the RuntimeEnv to ensure the specified version of pip is used. This can be done by setting pip_version in the dictionary sent to RuntimeEnv.\n\n   Example:\n   ```python\n   RuntimeEnv(\n       pip={\"packages\": [\"tensorflow\", \"requests\"], \"pip_check\": False, \"pip_version\": \"==22.0.2;python_version=='3.8.11'\"}\n   )\n   ```\n3. If you need to install a newer version of a package that already exists in the environment, specify the package name followed by its version in the 'pip' list of the 'runtime_env' for the actor or task options.\n\n   Example:\n   ```python\n   requests_version.options(\n       name=\"26\",\n       ray_actor_options={\"runtime_env\": {\"pip\": [\"requests==2.26.0\"]}}\n   ).deploy()\n   ```\n\n   The code snippet above forcefully upgrades the 'requests' package to version 2.26.0.\n\n4.

This means the operation immediately returns a promise or future, which is an identifier of the operation's result- a key element in achieving parallelism. Ray natively integrates with asyncio and can be used alongside async frameworks like aiohttp and aioredis. Ray enables arbitrary functions to be executed asynchronously on separate Python workers, called \"tasks\". Tasks can specify their resource requirements in terms of CPUs, GPUs, and custom resources. Additionally, async methods can be defined in Ray, which allows it to automatically detect whether an actor supports async calls. However, it's important to note that this is an experimental feature, meaning the semantic of the API may change and currently, it doesn't support Ray Client.",

This is facilitated through the async/await syntax that has been available since Python 3.5. Within a Ray AsyncActor, multiple invocations of a method can run concurrently in the event loop. This allows for the execution of concurrent workload like 'await asyncio.sleep(2)' which simply results in a pause of execution for 2 seconds.

Also, any installed `atexit` handlers in the actor will not be run. If you want to cancel tasks, use `ray.cancel()`. \n\nDo not regularly pass large arguments to remote task or method calls to avoid unnecessary overhead.

If you want Ray to automatically restart the actor, set a nonzero max_restarts in the @ray.remote options for the actor, then pass the flag no_restart=False to ray.kill.

This is commonly found in the directory '/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/dashboard.log'. It's also worth noting that for Ray to work effectively, the logger requires you to do a full installation via 'pip install \"ray[default]\"', as this supports more commands to access logs from Ray clusters. If you still can't see the 'log.info', you might be using the Ray client which lacks support for the new engine. Overall, checking the specifics of your Ray installation and configuration as well as the dashboard logs should help diagnose the issue with 'log.info'.",

From the info provided, the Ray Dashboard launches on the headnode when you start a remote Ray cluster, but this dashboard port is not publicly exposed, meaning you need an extra setup to access the dashboard from outside the head node. \n\nThe Ray Dashboard runs on port 8265 of the head node by default. If you want the dashboard to remain reliably open, you need to setup port forwarding or customize the port following the necessary instructions. \n\nIf you are looking to view the Ray Dashboard from outside the Head Node, the best course of action would be to follow instructions on configuring the dashboard. Keep in mind the dashboard is designed to help you understand the performance of your Ray applications plus identify potential issues. \n\nIf you've already set up port forwarding or customized the port and you are still having trouble, it could be an issue unique to your setup and you may want to seek further technical help.",

The working directory of the Trainable worker will be automatically changed to the corresponding Trial directory. You can access relative file paths in the Tune training function.\n   \n4. To change the working directory locally, you can use the `_change_working_directory(trial)` context manager. This changes the working directory to the trial's log directory.\n\n5. Keep in mind, running a tuning task may not yield meaningful outputs initially.

It manages cluster-level metadata and provides various cluster-level operations including actor, placement groups, and node management.

GCS server especially tends to use more memory as it's a centralized component that many other components in Ray communicate with. \n\nIn your specific case, your resources limit and requests are set to 2Gi of memory which may contribute to the high memory utilization. Also, if the head node has the same memory capacity as worker nodes, this could leading to higher memory usage. \n\nWhen faced with issues related to high memory utilization by GCS, it's recommended to adjust the max file descriptors limit per process using the ulimit command.",

            "question": "how to use Ray dataset on aws",
            "generated_answer": "To use the Ray dataset on AWS, you need to follow the steps below:\n\n1. Install the necessary packages, particularly Ray Data. This can be done using pip:\n  ```\n  pip install -U \"ray[data]\n  ```\n2. Once you've installed the necessary packages, import the necessary modules into your Python environment:\n  ```\n  from typing import Dict \n  import numpy as np\n  import ray\n  ```\n3. Start a Ray cluster using the Ray Cluster Launcher. Note that you can choose any machine learning framework that you prefer such as PyTorch, HuggingFace, or Tensorflow.\n\n4. Ray data can read from various sources including on-disk files, Python objects, and cloud storage like S3. The code to read a CSV file from an S3 bucket would look like this:\n   ```\n  ds = ray.data.read_csv(\"s3://[email protected]/iris.csv\")\n   ```\n5. If the data source you want to read from is not in the built-in list, you can implement a custom reader. Ray Data supports data in many formats, allowing you to ingest data of common formats from popular sources efficiently.\n\n6. Now that you have your dataset loaded, you can run your machine learning workload, using Ray's built-in capabilities or your preferred machine learning framework. For example, if you're working with the XGBoost framework, you can run Ray's XGBoost training benchmark.\n\nThe steps above should provide a good start to using Ray datasets on AWS. Please keep in mind these are fundamental steps, and depending on your requirements and the complexity of your tasks, you might need to adjust or add more steps.",
            "reference_answer": "You can use the Ray dataset on AWS by implementing the following steps: \n\n1. **Loading Data:** First, you need to load the data, which can be done from any filesystem supported by Arrow. This could be from on-disk files, Python objects, or cloud storage services like S3 on AWS. You would typically import the necessary library (ray) and then use the read_csv function to load the data as shown next:\n```python\nimport ray\nds = ray.data.read_csv('s3://[email\u00a0protected]/iris.csv')\n```\n\n2. **Transforming Data:** You can use user-defined functions (UDFs) to transform datasets by applying certain functions with the ```.map_batches()``` method on your dataset:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform_batch(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    vec_a = batch['petal length (cm)']\n    vec_b = batch['petal width (cm)']\n    batch['petal area (cm^2)'] = vec_a * vec_b\n    return batch\n\ntransformed_ds = ds.map_batches(transform_batch)\n```\n\n3. **Consuming Data:** You can pass datasets to Ray Tasks or Actors and access records with methods like ```take_batch()``` and ```iter_batches()```. Here's an example of using take_batch:\n\n```python\nprint(transformed_ds.take_batch(batch_size=3))\n```\nand an example of using tasks and actors:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote\ndef consume(ds: ray.data.Dataset) -> int:\n    num_batches = 0\n    for batch in ds.iter_batches(batch_size=8):\n        num_batches += 1\n    return num_batches\n\nray.get(consume.remote(transformed_ds))\n```\n\n4. **Saving Data:** Finally, you can save dataset contents to local or remote filesystems. You'd typically use the write_parquet() function:\n\n```python\nimport os\ntransformed_ds.write_parquet('/tmp/iris')\nprint(os.listdir('/tmp/iris'))\n```",

            "generated_answer": "To get more detailed errors or logs from Ray Serve when an internal failure occurs, you can use the debugging mechanisms provided by Ray. The standard mechanism is catching exceptions, which are raised when tasks fail. If a task raises an uncaught exception, then calling `ray.get` on the object ID returned by the task or an actor will propagate the exception to the caller. \n\n1. Use the `ray.exceptions` like `RayActorError`, `RayError`, `RaySystemError`, `RayTaskError`, etc. These can give you a specific sense of what error is occurring.\n\n2. There's also a lower-level API available to inspect the status of all objects in the system, called the `global state API`.\n\n3. It is worth noting that when the error takes place outside of a task \u2014 say, due to node failures or network issues \u2014 Ray will return a generic internal service error. However, Ray Serve logs these kinds of errors too (but not the application-level errors). So consider checking the logs in your Ray clusters to gain more insights.\n\n4. For networking related issues, Raylet can be a good tool to diagnose and fix problems.\n\nIt is important to note that the primary source of failures in Ray is from the .remote() API, which is used for creating tasks and actors, and the `ray.get()` API, used for getting results.

To extract checkpoints from a previously run Tune experiment, you can use `tune.ExperimentAnalysis.get_all_trials()`. This method returns a list of `tune.Trial` objects, and you can extract the checkpoint paths for each trial by accessing the `trial.checkpoint.value` attribute.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nfrom ray import tune\n\n# Replace \"<path_to_experiment_dir>\" with the directory you saved the experiment\nanalysis = tune.ExperimentAnalysis(experiment_dir=\"<path_to_experiment_dir>\")\n\n# Get all trials\ntrials = analysis.get_all_trials()\n\n# Iterate over trials and get checkpoint path\nfor trial in trials:\n    checkpoint_path = trial.checkpoint.value\n    print(f'Checkpoint path: {checkpoint_path}')\n\n```\n\nThis will print the paths to all checkpoints of your experiment.\n\nIn your question, you mention that your experiment used cloud checkpointing. Thus the checkpoint paths may correspond to cloud storage URLs, such as `s3://` paths if you used Amazon S3. You would need to set up proper cloud storage credentials and utilities like `boto3` for S3 to download your checkpoints.\n\nLet us know if you need a more specific example tailored to the cloud storage service you used.

Firstly, if you're using Ray Data with Ray Tune, you need to ensure there are enough free CPUs for Ray Data to run on. By default, Tune will try to fully utilize the cluster CPUs, which could potentially prevent Ray Data from scheduling tasks, reducing performance or causing workloads to hang. \n\nSecondly, take into account that a Ray task requires 1 CPU, but a Ray actor, once scheduled, occupies 0 CPU. This could explain the low CPU usage. The code snippets provided also indicate that the number of CPUs for running tasks or actors is set to 0 (`ray.remote(num_cpus=0)(run)` and `ray.remote(num_cpus=0)(TunerInternal)`), which means no additional CPUs are used for these tasks or actors.\n\nFinally, by default, Ray tasks use 1 CPU resource and Ray actors use 1 CPU for scheduling and 0 CPU for running. Therefore, even though the actors are running, they might not be using any CPU resources which could explain the low CPU usage.",
            "reference_answer": "The low CPU usage on your ray tuner may be caused by several reasons. It could be that Ray is using fewer cores than available, as it determines the number of CPUs on each machine using psutil.cpu_count(). It could also be because your tasks are very small which would introduce extra overhead for each task. Variable task durations can also slow down processing time, as the system ends up waiting for the slowest task to complete. If your tasks are all trying to use all of the cores on the machine, they might experience contention, preventing your application from achieving speedup. The solution to this problem depends on these factors.",

            "generated_answer": "To avoid objects getting spilled in Ray, you need to ensure that the object store capacity is not used up as objects are spilled to external storage once this happens. This can be achieved by managing your memory usage effectively. Here are potential steps:\n\n1. Increase the object store's size: If the memory capacity can be expanded, do so to accommodate more objects in the object store.\n2. Memory Management: Manage how objects are distributed and try to propagate fewer huge objects that take up significant space.\n3. Serialization: If the stored data can be serialized, this is another method to save memory space.\n4. If feasible, consider using high-performance storage like NVMe SSDs. The use of high-performance storage is crucial when object spilling is enabled as Ray will spill objects to the disk if necessary.\n\nKeep in mind that avoiding object spilling might be essential to keep the performance of your applications optimal, as spilling comes with a performance penalty due to writing data to disk. Be sure to check the documentation for the specific Ray version you're using for additional guidance on managing object spilling.",
            "reference_answer": "You can avoid objects from getting spilled in Ray by configuring the spilling directory using the 'object_spilling_config' setting and initializing Ray with it. You can specify single or multiple directories to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple devices. It's recommended to use an SSD for memory-intensive workloads, and if you're using an HDD, specify a large buffer size to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, Ray will throw 'OutOfDiskError' if the disk utilization exceeds a predefined threshold. You can adjust this threshold using the 'local_fs_capacity_threshold' setting. Also, object spilling to remote storage is possible using 'smart_open', although this feature is still experimental.",
