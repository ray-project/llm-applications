The error message suggests that the data type of the input batch is not compatible with the expected data type of the function you are applying.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try specifying the `batch_format` parameter in the `map_batches` method to match the data type of the input batch. For example, if the input batch is a dictionary of NumPy ndarrays, you can set `batch_format=\"numpy\"` in the `map_batches` method.\n\nAlternatively, you can also try converting the input batch to the expected data type before applying the function. For example, if the function expects a dictionary of NumPy ndarrays, you can convert the input batch to a dictionary of NumPy ndarrays using the `to_numpy` method.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the `map_batches` method uses tasks by default, so you may need to adjust the `batch_size` parameter to ensure that the batches are large enough to be processed efficiently.",

            "generated_answer": "  In a Ray Serve application, autoscaling works by automatically increasing or decreasing the number of replicas based on the load. The Ray autoscaler is a process that runs on the head node and adjusts the number of nodes in the cluster based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups. When the resource demands of the Ray workload exceed the current capacity of the cluster, the autoscaler will try to increase the number of worker nodes. When worker nodes sit idle, the autoscaler will remove worker nodes from the cluster. Similarly, when Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it will try to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The parameters include min_replicas, initial_replicas, max_replicas, and target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider.

It is built on top of the Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD) abstraction, which allows for flexible and efficient data processing. Spark also has a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools for data processing, machine learning, and graph processing.\n\nRay is a newer framework that is designed for distributed and parallel computing. It is built on top of the Actor Model, which allows for efficient and flexible parallelism. Ray is particularly well-suited for distributed machine learning and deep learning, and it has a growing ecosystem of libraries and tools for these use cases.\n\nDask is a Python-based framework that is designed for parallel and distributed computing. It is built on top of the Dask Array and Dask DataFrame abstractions, which allow for efficient and flexible data processing. Dask is particularly well-suited for data-intensive computing and machine learning, and it has a growing ecosystem of libraries and tools for these use cases.\n\nIn terms of performance, Spark is generally considered to be faster than Dask for large-scale data processing and machine learning, due to its more mature and optimized architecture. However, Dask has been shown to be faster than Spark for certain use cases, such as data-intensive computing and machine learning on distributed memory architectures.

            "generated_answer": "  \n\nTo set up the model to communicate gradient updates across machines using Ray AIR, you need to define a parameter server that will hold a copy of the model and apply the gradients received from the workers.\n\nHere's an example of how to define the parameter server using Ray AIR:\n```python\n@ray.remote\nclass ParameterServer(object):\n    def __init__(self, lr):\n        self.model = ConvNet()\n        self.optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(self.model.parameters(), lr=lr)\n```\nIn this example, the `ParameterServer` class is defined as a remote actor using the `@ray.remote` decorator. It initializes the model and optimizer, and sets the learning rate.\n\nTo use the parameter server in the training loop, you can create an instance of the `ParameterServer` class and pass it to the `train` function:\n```python\nps = ParameterServer.remote(1e-2)\nworkers = [DataWorker.remote() for i in range(num_workers)]\n\nfor epoch in range(num_epochs):\n    for worker in workers:\n        gradients = worker.compute_gradients.remote(ps.get_weights.remote())\n        ps.apply_gradients.remote(gradients)\n        ps.get_weights.remote()\n```\nIn this example, the `ParameterServer` instance `ps` is created and passed to the `train` function. The `train` function iterates over the workers and computes the gradients using the `compute_gradients` method. The gradients are then applied to the model using the `apply_gradients` method of the `ParameterServer`. Finally, the updated weights are retrieved from the `ParameterServer` using the `get_weights` method.\n\nThis is a basic example of how to set up the model to communicate gradient updates across machines using Ray AIR. You can modify this example to suit your specific use case.",

This callback will collect the results from the distributed workers and pass them to the driver, where they can be logged and displayed in TensorBoard.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `ReportCheckpointCallback` callback in a distributed TensorFlow training script:\n```\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Define the distributed training strategy\nstrategy = tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy()\n\n# Define the model and dataset\nmodel = ...\ndataset = ...\n\n# Define the training function\n@tf.function\ndef train_step(dataset):\n  # Train the model on the dataset\n  ...\n\n# Define the reporting callback\nreport_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.ReportCheckpointCallback(\n    log_dir='/path/to/log/dir',\n    report_interval=1000,\n    report_keys=['loss', 'accuracy'])\n\n# Train the model\nwith strategy.scope():\n  model.fit(dataset, epochs=10, callbacks=[report_callback])\n```\nIn this example, the `ReportCheckpointCallback` callback is defined with a `log_dir` parameter that specifies the directory where the results will be logged. The `report_interval` parameter specifies how often the results should be reported, and the `report_keys` parameter specifies which metrics should be reported.\n\nTo visualize the results in TensorBoard, you can run the following command:\n```\ntensorboard --logdir /path/to/log/dir\n```\nThis will start TensorBoard and display the results in the web interface.",

            "generated_answer": "  In the context of Ray Data, a batch and a block are different concepts. A batch is a user-facing object that represents a collection of rows, while a block is an internal abstraction that represents a subset of rows. Blocks are used to perform operations in parallel, and they are the building blocks of a Dataset.\n\nA Dataset is a sequence of Ray object references to blocks, and each block contains a disjoint subset of rows. When you iterate over a Dataset, you are iterating over the blocks, not the individual rows.\n\nThe batch size is the number of data points used to compute and apply one gradient update to the model weights. In the context of Ray Data, the batch size is used to control the size of the blocks that are created when iterating over a Dataset.\n\nWhen you use the `map_batches` method on a Dataset, you can specify the batch format, which determines the type of data that is returned when you iterate over the batches. The batch format can be \"numpy\", \"pandas\", or \"pyarrow\".\n\nThe `batch_to_block` method is used to create a block from user-facing data formats. It takes a batch of data and returns a block that can be used in Ray Data operations.\n\nIt's important to note that large block sizes can lead to potential out-of-memory situations, so it's important to make sure that no single item in your Ray Data is too large, and to always call `ds.map_batches()` with a batch size small enough such that the output batch can comfortably fit into memory.",

In particular, it requires a `Policy` object to be passed to its constructor, and it uses this `Policy` object to generate actions and compute advantages.\n\nIf you're trying to use the `RolloutWorker` class as a standalone object, you may be running into issues because the `Policy` object is not being properly initialized or updated. This can lead to deadlocks or other errors.\n\nTo fix this issue, you should consider using the `RolloutWorker` class as part of a larger RLlib training loop, or you can try using a different API that is designed to be used as a standalone object.

You can also check configured system limits with `ulimit -a` for other resource limit errors. For unexpected hangs or performance problems, you can use `ray stack` to dump the stack traces of all Ray workers on the current node, `ray timeline` to dump a timeline visualization of tasks to a file, and `ray memory` to list all object references in the cluster.

These options can be set in the Serve config file or on the @serve.deployment decorator. Some of the configurable parameters include the number of replicas, the route prefix, and the user_config. The user_config is a dictionary that can be used to pass additional parameters to the deployment.\n\nTo use the user config in Ray Serve, you can set the parameters in the Serve config file or on the @serve.deployment decorator. For example, to set the number of replicas for a deployment, you can add the following line to the Serve config file:\n```\ndeployments:\n  - name: MyDeployment\n    num_replicas: 2\n```\nAlternatively, you can set the number of replicas using the @serve.deployment decorator:\n```\n@serve.deployment(num_replicas=2)\nclass MyDeployment:\n    ...\n```\nYou can also use the user_config parameter to pass additional parameters to the deployment. For example:\n```\ndeployments:\n  - name: MyDeployment\n    user_config:\n      threshold: 1.5\n```\nYou can then access the user_config in the deployment's __init__ method or in the reconfigure method. For example:\n```\nclass MyDeployment:\n    def __init__(self, config):\n        self.threshold = config[\"threshold\"]\n```\nNote that the user_config is a dictionary, so you can pass any number of parameters to the deployment using this method.",

You can use the user_config field to supply structured configuration for your deployment. You can pass arbitrary JSON serializable objects to the YAML configuration. Serve then applies it to all running and future deployment replicas. The application of user configuration does not restart the replica. This means you can use this field to dynamically adjust model weights and versions without restarting the cluster, adjust traffic splitting percentage for your model composition graph, configure any feature flag, A/B tests, and hyper-parameters for your deployments. To enable the user_config feature, you need to implement a reconfigure method that takes a JSON-serializable object (e.g., a Dictionary, List or String) as its only argument. If the user_config is set when the deployment is created (e.g., in the decorator or the Serve config file), this reconfigure method is called right after the deployment\u2019s __init__ method, and the user_config is passed in as an argument.

This class allows you to configure the behavior of the trial when it fails, including whether to retry the trial or not.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `FailureConfig` to make a trial retry on failures:\n```\nfrom ray import tune\n\n# Define the trial function\ndef train_model(config):\n    # Train the model\n    pass\n\n# Define the search space\ntrial_space = {\n    \"param1\": tune.choice([1, 2, 3]),\n    \"param2\": tune.choice([4, 5, 6])\n}\n\n# Define the failure configuration\nfailure_config = tune.FailureConfig(\n    max_failures=3,  # Retry the trial up to 3 times\n    retry_delay=10,  # Wait 10 seconds before retrying\n    retry_on_failure=True  # Retry the trial on failure\n)\n\n# Start the trial\ntuner = tune.Tuner(train_model, param_space=trial_space, failure_config=failure_config)\nresults = tuner.fit()\n```\nIn this example, the `FailureConfig` class is used to configure the trial to retry up to 3 times on failure, with a delay of 10 seconds between retries. The `retry_on_failure` parameter is set to `True` to enable retries on failure.\n\nYou can also use the `on_trial_error` and `on_trial_recover` callbacks in Ray Tune to handle trial failures and retries. These callbacks are called when a trial fails or is recovered, respectively, and can be used to perform custom actions such as logging or sending notifications.\n\nFor more information on using Ray Tune for fault tolerance and recovery, see the Ray Tune documentation.",

            "generated_answer": "  To set the memory limit for each trial in Ray Tune, you can use the `with_resources` method and specify the number of CPUs to use for each trial. For example:\n```\ntrain_model = tune.with_resources(train_model, {\"cpu\": 1})\n```\nThis will limit each trial to use only 1 CPU. You can adjust the number of CPUs to use for each trial based on the resources available in your cluster.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `max_concurrent_trials` parameter in the `TuneConfig` object to limit the number of trials that can run concurrently. For example:\n```\nconfig = TuneConfig(\n    # ...\n    num_samples=100,\n    max_concurrent_trials=10,\n)\n```\nThis will limit the number of trials that can run concurrently to 10. You can adjust this value based on the resources available in your cluster.\n\nNote that the `with_resources` method is meant primarily to limit how many tasks should be in flight at the same time, and it can also be used to limit how many tasks can run concurrently. However, it is not recommended to use this method to limit the number of trials that can run concurrently, as it can hurt scheduling performance. Instead, you should use the `max_concurrent_trials` parameter in the `TuneConfig` object to control the number of concurrent trials.",

By default, this will send a `KeyboardInterrupt` to the task's worker if it is mid-execution. You can also pass `force=True` to force-exit the worker.\n\nIt's important to note that currently, Ray will not automatically retry tasks that have been cancelled. If you want to retry a task, you will need to manually resubmit it.\n\nHere is an example of how to cancel a Ray task:\n```\n@ray.remote\ndef my_task():\n    # Do some work\n    return \"Task completed\"\n\n# Start the task\ntask_ref = my_task.remote()\n\n# Cancel the task\nray.cancel(task_ref)\n```\nYou can also use the `ray.get()` function to check if the task was successfully cancelled. If the task was cancelled, `ray.get()` will raise a `ray.exceptions.TaskCancelledError`.\n```\ntry:\n    ray.get(task_ref)\nexcept ray.exceptions.TaskCancelledError:\n    print(\"Task was cancelled\")\n```\nIt's also worth noting that cancelling a task will not automatically cancel any child or Actor tasks that were created by the task. If you want to cancel all child and Actor tasks, you can pass `recursive=True` to the `ray.cancel()` function.\n```\nray.cancel(task_ref, recursive=True)\n```\nI hope this helps!

The function takes a batch of data as input, performs some computation on it, and returns the result.\n\nBy using the `__call__()` method, we can define a callable class that can be used to perform batch inference on a dataset.

The context provides several examples of how to define and use actors in Ray, but it does not provide a specific example of how to pickle a variable defined in an actor's init method.\n\nTo pickle a variable defined in an actor's init method, you can use the `ray.get` method to retrieve the variable from the actor and then use the `pickle.dumps` method to serialize the variable. Here is an example:\n```\nimport ray\nimport pickle\n\n@ray.remote\nclass MyActor:\n    def __init__(self, my_var):\n        self.my_var = my_var\n\n    def get_my_var(self):\n        return self.my_var\n\nactor = MyActor.remote(my_var=10)\nmy_var = ray.get(actor.get_my_var.remote())\npickled_my_var = pickle.dumps(my_var)\n```\nIn this example, the `MyActor` class has an `__init__` method that takes a `my_var` argument and sets it as an instance variable. The `get_my_var` method returns the `my_var` instance variable. The `ray.get` method is used to retrieve the `my_var` instance variable from the actor, and then the `pickle.dumps` method is used to serialize the `my_var` variable.\n\nIt is important to note that the `ray.get` method is used to retrieve the `my_var` instance variable from the actor, and not the `ray.get` method that is used to retrieve the actor itself. The `ray.get` method that is used to retrieve the actor itself is only used to retrieve the actor handle, and not the instance variables of the actor.",
            "reference_answer": "To pickle a variable defined in an actor\u2019s init method, you can customize your serialization process. One way is to define a __reduce__ function inside the corresponding class. This function will specify how to serialize the object. Another way is to register the class with the serializer you use, defining a custom serializer and deserializer for the class. Lastly, you can customize the serialization of a specific object by creating a helper class for serialization that includes a __reduce__ method.",

The context provides information about the Ray API and how to use it to perform collective operations among actors.\n\nTo perform an all-reduce operation among a list of actors using Ray, you can use the `ray.util.collective.collective.allreduce()` function. This function takes a list of tensors to be all-reduced, each on a GPU, and a group name to perform the all-reduce. The function returns None.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `allreduce()` function to perform an all-reduce operation among a list of actors:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Create a list of actors\nactors = [ray.remote(num_gpus=1) for _ in range(5)]\n\n# Create a list of tensors to be all-reduced\ntensor_list = [actor.buffer.ones((10,), dtype=cupy.float32) for actor in actors]\n\n# Perform the all-reduce operation\nray.util.collective.collective.allreduce(tensor_list, \"default\")\n```\nIn this example, we create a list of actors with one GPU each, and a list of tensors to be all-reduced. We then use the `allreduce()` function to perform the all-reduce operation among the actors, using the \"default\" collective group. The function returns None, and the all-reduced tensor is stored in the `buffer` attribute of each actor.",

The 'apply_reduce' function is used in the reduce phase of the MapReduce process, where the j-th return value from each mapper is sent to the j-th reducer. This is done by passing references to the data using Ray objects, which allows for the handling of large datasets that don\u2019t fit on one machine.

            "question": "How does Ray work with async.io ?",
            "generated_answer": "  Ray supports async.io through the use of the `@ray.remote` decorator. This decorator can be applied to both functions and classes, and it allows you to run remote functions and methods asynchronously.\n\nIn the example provided, the `AsyncActor` class is defined with an `async def` method, which is automatically detected by Ray as an async method. This allows Ray to schedule the method to run asynchronously on a worker process.\n\nTo call an async method, you can use the `remote` method to create a future object, which can be used to retrieve the result of the method when it completes. For example:\n```\nactor = AsyncActor.remote()\nfuture = actor.run_concurrent.remote()\nresult = ray.get(future)\n```\nAlternatively, you can use the `async` and `await` keywords to call the method and wait for the result, like this:\n```\nasync def async_get():\n    result = await actor.run_concurrent.remote()\n    return result\n\nresult = asyncio.run(async_get())\n```\nNote that when using async.io with Ray, it's important to be mindful of the number of concurrent tasks you're running, as this can impact the performance of your application. You can use the `ray.wait()` method to wait for multiple tasks to complete before retrieving their results, which can help to improve performance by reducing the number of RPCs (remote procedure calls) that need to be made.",

It supports async frameworks like aiohttp, aioredis, etc. Ray provides AsyncActor class for defining actors that can run concurrent tasks. ObjectRefs in Ray can be translated to asyncio.Futures or concurrent.futures.Future objects, allowing to await on ray futures in existing concurrent applications. Ray runs all of the methods inside a single python event loop. In async actors, only one task can be running at any point in time.

            "generated_answer": "  The GCS server is a centralized metadata server for a Ray cluster, running on the Ray head node. It manages node membership and actor directory. The GCS server is also known as the Global Control Store.\n\nThe GCS server takes up a significant amount of memory on the head node because it stores all the cluster-level metadata, including actor and placement group information. This is necessary for the GCS to function properly and to provide fault-tolerance for the cluster.\n\nTo reduce the memory usage of the GCS server, you can use Jemalloc, a memory profiling tool, to optimize the memory usage of the GCS server. You can also use environment variables to override LD_PRELOAD on the GCS server and provide 3 env vars for memory profiling.\n\nTo make the GCS fault-tolerant, you can use HA Redis, which is a Redis instance that is replicated across multiple nodes. When the GCS restarts, it loads all the data from the Redis instance and resumes regular functions.\n\nTo configure the head node, you can start by specifying the number of CPUs and memory capacity. The actual hardware specification depends on the workload and the size of the cluster. You can also monitor CPU usage, memory usage, and network bandwidth usage to decide the hardware specification.\n\nTo tune the operating system settings, you can increase the number of connections that the operating system can support. This is because all nodes and workers connect to the GCS, and many network connections will be created.\n\nTo add fault tolerance to the GCS, you can use KubeRay, which is a Kubernetes-based deployment of Ray. KubeRay allows you to deploy your Serve application with fault tolerance, so that your application can serve traffic even when the head node crashes.",

We then catch the `RaySystemError` exception using the `ray.exceptions` module, and handle it by printing a message to the console.\n\nYou can also use other exceptions provided by the `ray.exceptions` module to catch and handle different types of errors. For example, you can use `ray.exceptions.ObjectReconstructionFailedError` to catch errors related to object reconstruction, or `ray.exceptions.RuntimeEnvSetupError` to catch errors related to setting up the runtime environment.\n\nIt's important to note that you should only catch exceptions that you can handle gracefully.

This includes system-level logs from the Serve controller and proxy as well as access logs and custom user logs produced from within deployment replicas. You can parse these stored logs with a logging stack such as ELK or Loki to be able to search by deployment or replica. Serve supports Log Rotation of these logs through setting the environment variables RAY_ROTATION_MAX_BYTES and RAY_ROTATION_BACKUP_COUNT. To silence the replica-level logs or otherwise configure logging, configure the 'ray.serve' logger inside the deployment constructor.",

When you call `ray.cancel` on a task, Ray will attempt to cancel the task on a best-effort basis. If the task has already been scheduled, Ray will send a `KeyboardInterrupt` to the worker to interrupt the task.

It could be because the number of cores Ray is using is less than the tasks it needs to perform. It could also be due to the tasks being very small or having variable durations. Another reason could be that all of your tasks are attempting to use all of the cores on the machine, leading to contention and preventing your application from achieving a speedup. This is common with some versions of numpy. To avoid contention, set an environment variable like MKL_NUM_THREADS to 1.",

Ray writes logs to files in the directory /tmp/ray/session_*/logs on each Ray pod\u2019s file system. You can collect logs written to a pod\u2019s filesystem using one of two logging strategies: sidecar containers or daemonsets. For sidecar containers, you can process logs by configuring a log-processing sidecar for each Ray pod. Ray containers should be configured to share the /tmp/ray directory with the logging sidecar via a volume mount. For daemonsets, you can collect logs at the Kubernetes node level by deploying a log-processing daemonset onto the Kubernetes cluster\u2019s nodes.

Raylet failure: If a raylet process fails, the corresponding node will be marked as dead and is treated the same as node failure.\n2. Node failure: When a worker node fails, the actors running on it also fail. Serve detects that the actors have failed, and it attempts to respawn the actors on the remaining, healthy nodes.\n3. Low memory: If a node runs low on memory, the task running on it will be killed and the node will be marked as dead.\n4. Head node failure: You can simulate a head node failure by either killing the head pod or the head node.\n5. Placement group rescheduling: If nodes that contain some bundles of a placement group die, all the bundles are rescheduled on different nodes by GCS.\n6. NodeAffinitySchedulingStrategy: This strategy allows a task or actor to be scheduled onto a particular node specified by its node id. If the specified node doesn\u2019t exist or is infeasible, the task or actor will fail with TaskUnschedulableError or ActorUnschedulableError.\n7. provider.cache_stopped_nodes: If enabled, nodes will be stopped when the cluster scales down.

When a raylet process fails, the corresponding node will be marked as dead and is treated the same as node failure.

            "generated_answer": "  The reasons for spikes in node CPU utilization in Ray are:\n\n1. Insufficient resources: If the cluster is running low on resources, such as CPU or memory, Ray may experience spikes in CPU utilization as it tries to allocate resources to tasks and actors.\n2. Task and actor placement: Ray tries to place tasks and actors on the most suitable node based on their resource requirements. If a node is not suitable for a particular task or actor, Ray may experience spikes in CPU utilization as it tries to find a suitable node.\n3. Autoscaling: Ray's autoscaling feature can add or remove nodes from the cluster based on resource usage. If the autoscaler adds nodes, it may lead to spikes in CPU utilization as the new nodes are brought online.\n4. Preprocessing compute time: If the preprocessing step of a task or actor takes a long time, Ray may experience spikes in CPU utilization as it tries to parallelize the preprocessing.\n5. Memory usage: If a node runs low on memory, Ray may kill a task or actor to free up resources. This can lead to spikes in CPU utilization as the task or actor is restarted on a different node.\n\nTo address these issues, it is important to monitor resource usage and adjust the cluster configuration and autoscaling settings as needed. Additionally, optimizing the preprocessing step and using more efficient data structures can help reduce the load on the cluster.",
            "reference_answer": "Spikes in node CPU utilization can occur due to the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node. By default, Ray tasks require 1 CPU each and Ray actors require 0 CPU each, so the scheduler limits task concurrency to the available CPUs and actor concurrency to infinite. Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones. Tasks or actors that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM. To manage this, the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node can be reduced by increasing the amount of resources requested by them.",

Increase the object store memory: This can help reduce the likelihood of objects being spilled to disk.\n3. Use a distributed object store: This can help distribute the load across multiple nodes and reduce the likelihood of objects being spilled to disk.\n4. Configure object spilling: You can configure object spilling to use a specific directory or multiple directories to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices.\n5. Monitor disk usage: You can monitor disk usage to prevent running out of disk space, which can cause object spilling to fail.\n6. Adjust the local disk capacity threshold: You can adjust the threshold to disable the protection or set it to a lower value to prevent running out of disk space.\n7. Use a different storage backend: You can use a different storage backend, such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage, to store objects that are spilled to disk.\n8. Optimize your code: You can optimize your code to reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed and stored, which can help reduce the likelihood of objects being spilled to disk.\n9.

You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open).
