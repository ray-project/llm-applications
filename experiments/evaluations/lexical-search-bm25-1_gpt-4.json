The context provides information about the `map_batches` method and how it works, as well as some examples of how to use it.\n\nTo answer the query, I would suggest the following advice:\n\n1. Make sure that the data being processed is of the correct type and format. This will help ensure that the data is processed correctly and efficiently.\n2. Use the `batch_format` parameter in the `map_batches` method to specify the format of the batches. This will help ensure that the data is processed in the correct format and that the output is in the desired format.\n3. Use the `batch_size` parameter in the `map_batches` method to specify the size of the batches. This will help ensure that the data is processed in a way that is efficient and scalable.\n4. Consider using the `map_batches` method with the `batch_format` parameter set to \"numpy\" or \"pandas\" to take advantage of the performance benefits of these libraries.\n5. If you are working with large datasets, consider using the `map_batches` method with the `batch_size` parameter set to a smaller value to avoid potential out-of-memory issues.\n\nOverall, the key to successful data type conversions when using the `map_batches` method in Ray Data is to carefully consider the format and size of the batches, and to use the appropriate parameters to ensure that the data is processed correctly and efficiently.",
            "reference_answer": "You can specify the batch format in the map_batches() function. If you're working with NumPy ndarrays, your function should accept and return a dictionary of ndarrays. If you're working with pandas DataFrames, your function should accept and return a DataFrame.

            "generated_answer": "  In a Ray Serve application, autoscaling works by automatically increasing or decreasing the number of replicas based on the load of the application. The Ray autoscaler is a process that runs on the head node or as a sidecar container in the head pod if using Kubernetes. It adjusts the number of nodes in the cluster based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups. The Ray Serve autoscaler sits on top of the Ray Autoscaler and asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If the Ray Autoscaler determines there aren't enough available CPUs to place these actors, it responds by requesting more Ray nodes, which the underlying cloud provider will then add. Load metrics are based on application semantics, using logical resources expressed in task and actor annotations.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas. This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The parameters include min_replicas, initial_replicas, max_replicas, and target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it tries to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

For example:\n```\napiVersion: ray.io/v1\nkind: RayService\nmetadata:\n  name: my-ray-service\nspec:\n  serveConfig: |\n    importPath: \"sleepy_pid:app\"\n    runtimeEnv: |\n      working_dir: \"https://github.com/ray-project/serve_config_examples/archive/42d10bab77741b40d11304ad66d39a4ec2345247.zip\"\n    deployments:\n      - name: SleepyPid\n        numReplicas: 6\n        rayActorOptions:\n          numCpus: 0\n```\nThis YAML string defines a deployment with the name \"SleepyPid\" that has 6 replicas and uses 0 CPUs.\n\nYou can also update the user config by updating the serveConfig field in the RayService CR and reapplying the changes to the Ray cluster. This can be done using the Serve CLI or by updating the YAML file and reapplying it to the cluster.\n\nIt's important to note that the user config is a YAML multi-line string, so it's important to ensure that the YAML is properly formatted and indented. Additionally, the user config is not type-checked, so it's important to ensure that the configuration options are correct and valid.",
            "reference_answer": "User config in Ray Serve is a configuration that you can pass to the reconfigure method of the deployment. This configuration can be updated dynamically without restarting the replicas of the deployment. The user_config must be fully JSON-serializable. You can use the user_config field to supply structured configuration for your deployment. You can pass arbitrary JSON serializable objects to the YAML configuration. Serve then applies it to all running and future deployment replicas. The application of user configuration does not restart the replica. This means you can use this field to dynamically adjust model weights and versions without restarting the cluster, adjust traffic splitting percentage for your model composition graph, configure any feature flag, A/B tests, and hyper-parameters for your deployments. To enable the user_config feature, you need to implement a reconfigure method that takes a JSON-serializable object (e.g., a Dictionary, List or String) as its only argument. If the user_config is set when the deployment is created (e.g., in the decorator or the Serve config file), this reconfigure method is called right after the deployment\u2019s __init__ method, and the user_config is passed in as an argument. You can also trigger the reconfigure method by updating your Serve config file with a new user_config and reapplying it to your Ray cluster.",

            "generated_answer": "  To make a Ray Tune trial retry on failures, you can use the `ray.train.FailureConfig` class to configure the experiment to stop on trial failures. With this configuration, if any trial encounters an error, the entire experiment will stop immediately.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `ray.train.FailureConfig` to stop the experiment on trial failures:\n```\nfrom ray import train, tune\nimport time\n\ndef my_failing_trainable(config):\n    if config[\"should_fail\"]:\n        raise RuntimeError(\"Failing (on purpose)!\")\n    # Do some training...\n    time.sleep(10)\n    train.report({\"mean_accuracy\": 0.9})\n\ntuner = tune.Tuner(\n    trainable=my_failing_trainable,\n    param_space={\"should_fail\": [True, False]},\n    run_config=train.RunConfig(\n        failure_config=train.FailureConfig(max_failures=3)\n    )\n)\n\nresults = tuner.fit()\n```\nIn this example, the `FailureConfig` class is used to configure the experiment to stop on trial failures. The `max_failures` parameter is set to 3, which means that the experiment will stop after 3 failed trials.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.tune.Callback.on_trial_error` and `ray.tune.Callback.on_trial_recover` callbacks to handle trial failures and restarts. These callbacks are called when a trial encounters an error and is restarted, respectively. You can use these callbacks to implement custom logic for handling trial failures and restarts.\n\nFor example, you can use the `on_trial_error` callback to log the error and the `on_trial_recover` callback to log the recovery. Here is an example of how to use these callbacks:\n```\nfrom ray import train, tune\nimport time\n\ndef my_failing_trainable(config):\n    if config[\"should_fail\"]:\n        raise RuntimeError(\"Failing (on purpose)!\")\n    # Do some training...\n    time.sleep(10)\n    train.report({\"mean_accuracy\": 0.9})\n\ntuner = tune.Tuner(\n    trainable=my_failing_trainable,\n    param_space={\"should_fail\": [True, False]},\n    run_config=train.RunConfig(\n        failure_config=train.FailureConfig(max_failures=3)\n    )\n)\n\nresults = tuner.fit()\n\ndef on_trial_error(iteration, trials, trial, **info):\n    print(f\"Trial {trial.trial_id} failed at iteration {iteration}\")\n\ndef on_trial_recover(iteration, trials, trial, **info):\n    print(f\"Trial {trial.trial_id} recovered at iteration {iteration}\")\n\ntuner.on_trial_error = on_trial_error\ntuner.on_trial_recover = on_trial_recover\n```\nIn this example, the `on_trial_error` callback is called when a trial encounters an error, and the `on_trial_recover` callback is called when a trial is restarted. The callbacks log the error and recovery to the console.",

            "generated_answer": "  To read a large text file in S3 with Ray, you can use the `read_text` method and specify the S3 URI of the file. For example:\n```\nimport ray\n\nds = ray.data.read_text(\"s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/this.txt\")\n```\nThis will create a dataset with a single column named \"text\" that contains the contents of the text file. You can then use the `ds.schema()` method to view the schema of the dataset.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `read_binary_files` method to read the file as a binary file and then manually decode the data. For example:\n```\nimport ray\n\nds = ray.data.read_binary_files(\"s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/this.txt\")\n```\nThis will create a dataset with a single column named \"bytes\" that contains the binary data of the file. You can then use the `ds.schema()` method to view the schema of the dataset.\n\nNote that if you want to load the data from a private bucket, you have to run `import pyarrow.fs` and specify the `fs` parameter in the `read_text` or `read_binary_files` method. For example:\n```\nimport ray\nimport pyarrow.fs\n\nfs = pyarrow.fs.S3FileSystem(access_key=\"YOUR_ACCESS_KEY\", secret_key=\"YOUR_SECRET_KEY\")\nds = ray.data.read_text(\"s3://bucket/path\", fs=fs)\n```\nThis will create a dataset with a single column named \"text\" that contains the contents of the text file in the specified bucket and path.

This can happen when the actor is implicitly capturing a large array or object in scope.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try the following:\n\n1. Use `ray.put()` to put large objects in the Ray object store. This will allow the actor to access the object without having to store it in memory.\n2. Move the data loader to the training function. This will allow the actor to access the data without having to store it in memory.\n3. Enable and configure the memory monitor to detect and resolve memory issues.\n4. Use the `ActorPoolStrategy` to configure the number of concurrent workers and the batch prefetching vs. inference task queueing tradeoff.\n5. Implement a class to perform setup in `__init__` and transform data in `__call__`.\n6. Create an `ActorPoolStrategy` and configure the number of concurrent workers. Each worker transforms a partition of data.\n7. Call `map_batches()` and pass the `ActorPoolStrategy` to compute.\n8. Use `ray.put()` to put large objects in the Ray object store.

First, you need to initialize the Ray Jobs Python SDK by calling `ray.init()` and passing in the address of the Ray cluster head node.\n2. Next, you need to create a `JobSubmissionClient` object and pass in the address of the Ray cluster head node.\n3. Then, you can use the `submit_job` method of the `JobSubmissionClient` object to submit a job. The `submit_job` method takes in the entrypoint command, the runtime environment, and any other necessary arguments.\n4. Finally, you can use the `get_job_status` method of the `JobSubmissionClient` object to check the status of the job.\n\nHere's an example of how to submit a job with Python using local files:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Initialize the Ray Jobs Python SDK\nray.init()\n\n# Create a JobSubmissionClient object\nclient = ray.job_submission.JobSubmissionClient(\"http://127.0.0.1:8265\")\n\n# Submit a job\njob_id = client.submit_job(\n    # Entrypoint shell command to execute\n    entrypoint=\"python script.py\",\n    # Path to the local directory that contains the script.py file\n    runtime_env={\"working_dir\": \"./\"}\n)\n\n# Check the status of the job\nstatus = client.get_job_status(job_id)\nprint(f\"status: {status}\")\n```\nIn this example, the `script.py` file is located in the current working directory, and the `runtime_env` argument is used to specify the working directory.

Finally, submit the job using the command 'ray job submit --working-dir your_working_directory -- python script.py'. This will run the script on the Ray Cluster and wait until the job has finished.

One way to do this is by using Ray Data, which allows you to express your inference job directly in Python instead of YAML or other formats.

This allows you to perform batch inference with Torch models by mapping a pre-trained model over your data.\n\nAnother way to optimize expensive CPU preprocessing is to separate the preprocessing and inference logic into separate stages. This allows inference on batch N to execute concurrently with preprocessing on batch N+1.\n\nIt is also possible to use GPUs for inference by moving the model and data to and from GPU, as shown in the example.

The test will then assert that the result of the function is equal to `4`.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.cluster_utils.Cluster` class to create a mini-cluster for testing purposes. Here's an example of how to use this class:\n```\nimport unittest\nimport ray\nfrom ray.cluster_utils import Cluster\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a mini-cluster with 4 CPUs and 0 GPUs\n        self.cluster = Cluster(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n        self.cluster.start()\n\n    def test_ray_function(self):\n        # Define a Ray function\n        @ray.remote\n        def my_function(x):\n            return x * 2\n\n        # Call the Ray function\n        result = my_function.remote(2)\n\n        # Assert that the result is correct\n        self.assertEqual(result, 4)\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        # Stop the mini-cluster\n        self.cluster.stop()\n```\nThis test will create a mini-cluster with 4 CPUs and 0 GPUs, and then call the `my_function` function with the argument `2`. The test will then assert that the result of the function is equal to `4`. Finally, the test will stop the mini-cluster.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.test` module to write unit tests for Ray code. Here's an example of how to use this module:\n```\nimport unittest\nimport ray\nfrom ray.test import RayTestCase\n\nclass RayTest(RayTestCase):\n    def test_ray_function(self):\n        # Define a Ray function\n        @ray.remote\n        def my_function(x):\n            return x * 2\n\n        # Call the Ray function\n        result = my_function.remote(2)\n\n        # Assert that the result is correct\n        self.assertEqual(result, 4)\n```\nThis test will start a new Ray cluster with 4 CPUs and 0 GPUs, and then call the `my_function` function with the argument `2`. The test will then assert that the result of the function is equal to `4`.\n\nIn general, it's a good idea to use the `ray.test` module to write unit tests for Ray code, as it provides a convenient way to start and stop the Ray cluster for each test.",
            "reference_answer": "To write unit tests for Ray code, you can use the unittest module in Python. You can start a new Ray cluster for each test in the setUp method and shut it down in the tearDown method. However, starting and stopping a Ray cluster can add significant latency. To reduce this, you can share the Ray cluster across tests by initializing it in the setUpClass method and shutting it down in the tearDownClass method. Be aware that there are certain cases where it may be unsafe to reuse a Ray cluster across tests, such as if your application depends on setting environment variables per process or if your remote actor/task sets any sort of process-level global variables.",

            "question": "How does Ray work with async.io ?",
            "generated_answer": "  Ray supports async.io through its integration with the asyncio library in Python. With Ray, you can define actors that can execute tasks asynchronously using the async/await syntax. This allows you to write concurrent code that can take advantage of the CPU's idle time while waiting for I/O operations to complete.\n\nTo use async.io with Ray, you can define an actor with async methods and use the `ray.get()` method to retrieve the results of the tasks. The `ray.get()` method is asynchronous and will not block the execution of the event loop.\n\nHere's an example of how to use async.io with Ray:\n```\nimport ray\nimport asyncio\n\n@ray.remote\nclass AsyncActor:\n    async def run_concurrent(self):\n        print(\"started\")\n        await asyncio.sleep(2) # concurrent workload here\n        print(\"finished\")\n\nactor = AsyncActor.remote()\n\n# regular ray.get\nray.get([actor.run_concurrent.remote() for _ in range(4)])\n```\nIn this example, the `AsyncActor` class has an async method `run_concurrent` that performs some concurrent workload. The `ray.get()` method is used to retrieve the results of the tasks, which are executed asynchronously using the `ray.remote()` decorator.\n\nNote that in async actors, only one task can be running at any point in time (though tasks can be multi-plexed). There will be only one thread in AsyncActor! See Threaded Actors if you want a threadpool.",
            "reference_answer": "Ray integrates natively with asyncio and allows for concurrent code execution using async/await syntax. It supports async frameworks like aiohttp, aioredis, etc. Ray provides AsyncActor class for defining actors that can run concurrent tasks. ObjectRefs in Ray can be translated to asyncio.Futures or concurrent.futures.Future objects, allowing to await on ray futures in existing concurrent applications. Ray runs all of the methods inside a single python event loop. In async actors, only one task can be running at any point in time. The number of concurrent tasks running at once can be set using the max_concurrency flag.",

            "generated_answer": "  To debug a hanging `ray.get()` call, you can use the Ray debugger. Here's an example of how to do it:\n\n1. First, make sure you have the Ray debugger installed by running `pip install ray[debug]`.\n2. Next, add a breakpoint to your code where you want to start debugging. You can do this by adding the line `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` to your code.\n3. Run your code with the debugger enabled by adding the `--debug` flag to your `ray up` command. For example: `ray up --debug my_script.py`.\n4. When the breakpoint is hit, you can use the debugger to step through your code and inspect the state of the objects. For example, you can use the `p` command to print the value of a variable, or the `remote` command to jump into a remote function.\n5. If you find that the `ray.get()` call is hanging, you can use the `ray debug` command to inspect the state of the object reference. For example, you can use the command `ray debug <object_ref>` to see the status of the object reference.\n6. If the object reference is in the \"pending\" state, it means that the object has not been computed yet. You can use the `ray debug` command to see the status of the task that is computing the object. For example, you can use the command `ray debug <task_ref>` to see the status of the task.\n7. If the task is in the \"pending\" state, it means that the task has not been scheduled yet. You can use the `ray debug` command to see the status of the actor that is responsible for scheduling the task. For example, you can use the command `ray debug <actor_ref>` to see the status of the actor.\n8. If the actor is in the \"pending\" state, it means that the actor has not been created yet. You can use the `ray debug` command to see the status of the actor's creation. For example, you can use the command `ray debug <actor_ref>.create()` to see the status of the actor's creation.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to debug a hanging `ray.get()` call and identify the root cause of the problem.",

Here is an example:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.util.actor_pool import ActorPool\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def double(self, v):\n        return 2 * v\n\na1, a2 = Actor.remote(), Actor.remote()\npool = ActorPool([a1])\npool.push(a2)\n```\nIn this example, `Actor` is a Ray actor class, and `a1` and `a2` are instances of that class. The `ActorPool` class is used to manage a pool of actors, and the `push()` method is used to add a new actor to the pool.\n\nYou can also call an Actor by using the `ray.remote` decorator and the `Remote` method. Here is an example:\n```\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Counter:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.i = 0\n\n    def get(self):\n        return self.i\n\n    def incr(self, value):\n        self.i += value\n\n# Create a Counter actor.\nc = Counter.remote()\n```\nIn this example, `Counter` is a Ray actor class, and `c` is an instance of that class. The `Remote` method is used to create a remote instance of the `Counter` class, which can then be used to execute remote method calls and maintain its own internal state.",

It's also known as the Global Control Store. The GCS server takes up a lot of memory on the head node because it stores all the metadata for the cluster in memory. This is necessary for the GCS to function properly.\n\nTo address the issue of the GCS server taking up too much memory, you can try the following:\n\n1. Use a larger head node with more memory to accommodate the GCS server.\n2. Use a distributed database like HA Redis to store the metadata instead of in-memory. This will allow the GCS server to scale beyond the memory limits of a single node.\n3. Optimize the GCS server configuration to use less memory. This can be done by adjusting the `RAY_GCS_SERVER_MEMORY` environment variable.\n4. Use a different Ray cluster management tool that has a more efficient GCS server implementation.\n\nIt's important to note that the GCS server is a critical component of the Ray cluster, and any issues with it can impact the overall performance and stability of the cluster.

You can do this by running `ray config` or `kubectl get configmap`.\n4. Check the Kubernetes cluster to ensure that it has enough resources to accommodate the Ray cluster. You can do this by running `kubectl describe nodes` or `kubectl top nodes`.\n5. If you are using a cloud provider, check the cloud provider's documentation for any known issues or limitations that may be affecting the Ray cluster.\n6. Try restarting the Ray cluster using `ray up --restart-only` or `kubectl rollout restart deployment/ray-cluster`.\n7. If the issue persists, try reducing the number of nodes in the Ray cluster or increasing the resources available to the Kubernetes cluster.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Ray Tune automatically synchronizes files and checkpoints between different remote nodes as needed, but this can be a performance bottleneck, especially when running many trials in parallel. Instead, you should use shared storage for checkpoints so that no additional synchronization across nodes is necessary.",

The Kuberay operator logs contain information about the Serve application deployment event and Serve application health checks.\n\nAlternatively, you can check the controller log and deployment log, which are located under `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/` in both the head node pod and worker node pod. These logs contain information about specific deployment failure reasons and autoscaling events.\n\nYou can also use Loki to filter your Ray Serve logs and gather insights quicker. To do this, use the following LogQL query: `{job=\"ray\"} |= \"Counter\"`. This will show you the logs for the Counter deployment.\n\nIf you want to see the logs for a specific deployment, you can use the Ray Dashboard. The Ray Dashboard is available both during local testing and on a remote cluster in production. You can access the Ray Dashboard at port 8265 at your cluster\u2019s URI. For example, if you\u2019re running Ray Serve locally, you can access the dashboard by going to `http://localhost:8265` in your browser.\n\nOnce you are in the Ray Dashboard, you can go to the Serve page to see the logs for your deployment. The Serve page shows you the list of deployments under each application, as well as the list of replicas for each deployment. You can also see the logs for each replica by clicking on the replica name.\n\nIf you want to see the logs for a specific replica, you can use the Ray client logs. The Ray client logs can be found at `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs` on the head node.\n\nIn summary, there are several ways to see logs for a failed Ray Serve deployment, including checking the Kuberay operator logs, the controller log and deployment log, using Loki, and using the Ray Dashboard.",

This suggests that the task is not being scheduled properly, and is not using the available CPU resources.\n\nOne possible reason for this could be that the Ray cluster currently does not have any available CPUs. This can happen if the cluster resources are used by Actors or Tune trials, as mentioned in the error message.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try limiting the number of concurrent Tune trials with the `max_concurrent_trials` Tune option. This will ensure that there are enough free CPUs for Ray Data to run on.\n\nAlternatively, you can try using the `ray.data.range` function to schedule the data processing tasks on a separate set of CPUs, as mentioned in the error message. This can help to prevent the data processing tasks from competing with the Tune trials for CPU resources.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the error message mentions that the Dataset job will hang unless more CPUs are freed up. This suggests that the issue may be related to the availability of CPU resources in the Ray cluster.",

            "generated_answer": "  To add a timeout for a Ray job, you can use the `timeout_s` parameter in the `RayDaskCallback` class. This parameter specifies the maximum amount of time to wait for a task to complete before raising a `GetTimeoutError`.\n\nHere's an example:\n```\nfrom ray.exceptions import GetTimeoutError\n\nclass MyTimerCallback(RayDaskCallback):\n    def _ray_pretask(self, key, object_refs):\n        # Executed at the start of the Ray task.\n        start_time = timer()\n        return start_time\n\n    def _ray_posttask(self, key, result, pre_state):\n        # Executed at the end of the Ray task.\n        execution_time = timer() - pre_state\n        print(f\"Execution time for task {key}: {execution_time}s\")\n\n    def _ray_get(self, object_refs, timeout=None):\n        # Executed when calling ray.get()\n        if timeout is not None:\n            try:\n                return ray.get(object_refs, timeout=timeout)\n            except GetTimeoutError:\n                print(f\"Timeout reached for object refs {object_refs}\")\n                return None\n        else:\n            return ray.get(object_refs)\n```\nIn this example, the `MyTimerCallback` class defines a `_ray_get` method that calls `ray.get()` with a specified timeout. If the timeout is reached, the method will print a message and return `None`.\n\nYou can use this callback class to set a timeout for a Ray job by passing it as an argument to the `ray.job.submit()` method:\n```\nray.job.submit(\n    # ...\n    callbacks=[MyTimerCallback(timeout_s=300)],\n    # ...\n)\n```\nIn this example, the `MyTimerCallback` class is passed as a callback to the `ray.job.submit()` method with a timeout of 300 seconds (5 minutes). If the job takes longer than 5 minutes to complete, the callback will print a message and return `None`.",
            "reference_answer": "The context does not provide a direct way to add a timeout for the Ray job. It only explains how to submit a job without waiting for it to finish using the --no-wait flag, how to check the job's status, and how to stop the job.",

            "generated_answer": "  To set a custom /tmp directory for a remote cluster, you can use the `RAY_TEMPDIR` environment variable. This variable defines where the temporary directory for the cluster files should be created.\n\nFor example, you can set `RAY_TEMPDIR` to a local directory on your machine, and then use the `ray submit` command to start a job on a remote cluster. The job will use the specified directory as its temporary directory.\n\nHere's an example command:\n```\nRAY_TEMPDIR=\"/path/to/local/tmp\" ray submit CLUSTER.YAML --tmux --start --stop tune_experiment.py -- --address=localhost:6379\n```\nIn this example, `CLUSTER.YAML` is the configuration file for the remote cluster, and `tune_experiment.py` is the script that you want to run on the cluster. The `--tmux` flag tells `ray submit` to start a tmux session on the remote cluster, and the `--start` and `--stop` flags tell it to start and stop the cluster as needed. The `--address` flag specifies the address of the remote cluster.\n\nNote that the `RAY_TEMPDIR` environment variable must be set on the machine that is running the `ray submit` command, not on the remote cluster.",

These APIs allow you to retrieve log files from a specific node in the Ray cluster.\n\nTo use these APIs, you will need to provide the address of the Ray cluster, the node ID or IP of the node containing the logs, and the name of the log file you want to retrieve. You can also use the `ray.util.state.get_log` API to retrieve logs for a specific actor or task by providing the actor or task ID.\n\nNote that these APIs only work for logs that are still available on the node. If the node has been terminated or the logs have been cleared, you will not be able to access them using these APIs.",

Ray writes logs to files in the directory /tmp/ray/session_*/logs on each Ray pod\u2019s file system. You can collect logs written to a pod\u2019s filesystem using one of two logging strategies: sidecar containers or daemonsets. For sidecar containers, you can process logs by configuring a log-processing sidecar for each Ray pod. Ray containers should be configured to share the /tmp/ray directory with the logging sidecar via a volume mount. For daemonsets, you can collect logs at the Kubernetes node level by deploying a log-processing daemonset onto the Kubernetes cluster\u2019s nodes. It is key to mount the Ray container\u2019s /tmp/ray directory to the relevant hostPath.",

Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones. Tasks or actors that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM.

This will allow more objects to be stored in memory, reducing the need for spilling.\n2. Use a faster storage device: If you are using a slow storage device, such as a hard drive, you can try using a faster device, such as an SSD, to improve the performance of object spilling.\n3. Adjust the object spilling threshold: You can adjust the object spilling threshold by setting the `local_fs_capacity_threshold` parameter. This will determine when object spilling occurs and can help prevent running out of disk space.\n4. Use a distributed storage system: If you are using a distributed storage system, such as a distributed file system, you can configure Ray to use it for object spilling. This can help improve the performance of object spilling and reduce the need for local storage.\n5. Disable object spilling: If you are experiencing issues with object spilling, you can disable it by setting the `object_spilling_config` parameter to `None`. This will prevent objects from being spilled to disk, but may cause significant performance problems if the object store memory is not sufficient.",

You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open).
