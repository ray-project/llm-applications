The Ray Autoscaler, a process that runs on the head node, scales the cluster up and down based on resource demand. It increases the number of worker nodes when the resource demands exceed the current capacity of the cluster and removes worker nodes when they sit idle. The Ray Serve Autoscaler, an application-level autoscaler, requests Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren't enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider.",

The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider.

Instead, it's more efficient to create 'key pools' where an actor can hold 1=many keys. This is because each actor can handle multiple keys and the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node can be reduced by increasing the amount of resources requested by them. Furthermore, the number of actors is usually determined by the number of Ray nodes in the cluster multiplied by four, and each worker can provide a significant number of records per second.",

If the object is a numpy array or a collection of numpy arrays, the get call is zero-copy and returns arrays backed by shared object store memory. Otherwise, the object data is deserialized into a Python object. You can also set a timeout to return early from a get that's blocking for too long.

It supports async frameworks like aiohttp, aioredis, etc. Ray provides AsyncActor class for defining actors that can run concurrent tasks. ObjectRefs in Ray can be translated to asyncio.Futures or concurrent.futures.Future objects, allowing to await on ray futures in existing concurrent applications. Ray runs all of the methods inside a single python event loop. In async actors, only one task can be running at any point in time. The number of concurrent tasks running at once can be set using the max_concurrency flag.",

For example, if you're using the `RayTrainReportCallback`, you would do:\n\n```python\ntrainer = Trainer(\n    model=model,\n    args=training_args,\n    train_dataset=small_train_ds,\n    eval_dataset=small_eval_ds,\n    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,\n)\n\ntrainer.add_callback(RayTrainReportCallback())\n```\n\nIf you want to implement a custom callback, you can create a class that inherits from `TrainerCallback` and override its methods. For example:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers.trainer_callback import TrainerCallback\n\nclass MyTrainReportCallback(TrainerCallback):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.metrics = {}\n```\n\nThen, you can add this custom callback to the trainer in the same way:\n\n```python\ntrainer.add_callback(MyTrainReportCallback())\n```",

Here is an example:\n\n```yaml\n# An unique identifier for the head node and workers of this cluster.\ncluster_name: default\n\n# The maximum number of workers nodes to launch in addition to the head\n# node.\nmax_workers: 10\n\n# The autoscaler will scale up the cluster faster with higher upscaling speed.\n# E.g., if the task requires adding more nodes then autoscaler will gradually\n# scale up the cluster in chunks of upscaling_speed*currently_running_nodes.\n# This number should be > 0.\nupscaling_speed: 1.0\n```\n\nThen, you can use the `ray up` command to start the cluster:\n\n```bash\n$ ray up -y config.yaml\n```\n\nThis will start a Ray cluster with a maximum of 10 nodes, but it won't necessarily start with 10 nodes immediately.

It manages node membership and actor directory, and provides cluster-level operations including actor, placement groups, and node management. The GCS server runs on the Ray head node and can take up a lot of memory due to its functions and the additional system processes running on the head node. If your GCS server is taking up too much memory, it could be due to running too many tasks and actors on the head node.

It has more fine-grained control over scale-down than the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. It determines the desired scale and selects precisely which pods to scale down.

Instead, the Ray autoscaler, a Ray cluster process, automatically scales a cluster up and down based on resource demand. It adjusts the number of nodes (Ray pods) in the cluster based on the resources required by tasks, actors, or placement groups. The autoscaler also removes nodes after they become idle for some time.

You can collect logs written to a pod\u2019s filesystem using one of two logging strategies: sidecar containers or daemonsets. For sidecar containers, you can process logs by configuring a log-processing sidecar for each Ray pod. Ray containers should be configured to share the /tmp/ray directory with the logging sidecar via a volume mount. For daemonsets, you can collect logs at the Kubernetes node level by deploying a log-processing daemonset onto the Kubernetes cluster\u2019s nodes.

Increased preprocessing compute time: Adding more CPU-only nodes can help parallelize preprocessing and reduce CPU utilization.\n2. Insufficient resources: If a user tries to launch an actor, task, or placement group but there are insufficient resources, the request will be queued, potentially leading to increased CPU utilization.\n3. Extra stress on the head node: Ray\u2019s architecture means that the head node has extra stress due to additional system processes running on it like GCS.\n4. Memory usage: If the node is running low on memory, tasks may be killed, potentially leading to spikes in CPU utilization as tasks are restarted or moved.\n5. Autoscaling: The autoscaler adds nodes to satisfy resource demands in a queue and removes nodes after they become idle for some time. This can cause fluctuations in CPU utilization.",
            "reference_answer": "Spikes in node CPU utilization can occur due to the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node. By default, Ray tasks require 1 CPU each and Ray actors require 0 CPU each, so the scheduler limits task concurrency to the available CPUs and actor concurrency to infinite. Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones. Tasks or actors that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM. To manage this, the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node can be reduced by increasing the amount of resources requested by them.",

If not, ensure that the Ray GCS with the matching version started successfully at the specified address and there is no firewall setting preventing access.\n\n2. If the head node is inaccessible, check if it is running, if the specified address is correct, or if there are firewall settings preventing access. You can use tools like nmap or nc to check if each port can be reached from a node.\n\n3. If the issue persists, consider making the GCS fault tolerant by using HA Redis. This allows the GCS to load all the data from the Redis instance and resume regular functions when it restarts.\n\n4. If you are using Kubernetes but not KubeRay, ensure that the GCS is backed by Redis so that it can recover the state by reading from Redis when it restarts. If the raylet fails to reconnect to the GCS for more than 60 seconds, you can tune the timeout threshold using the OS environment variable RAY_gcs_rpc_server_reconnect_timeout_s.\n\n5. If the worker init container is stuck in Init:0/1 status, check if the GCS server process has failed in the head Pod, if the ray executable is included in the $PATH for the image, or if the CLUSTER_DOMAIN environment variable is set correctly.",
