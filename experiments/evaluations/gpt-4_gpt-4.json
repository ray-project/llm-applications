Configure the batch format: Ray Data represents batches as dicts of NumPy ndarrays or pandas DataFrames by default. You can specify the batch format in `map_batches()`.\n\n2. Be mindful of the batch size: Large block size can lead to potential out-of-memory situations. Make sure no single item in your Ray Data is too large, and always call `ds.map_batches()` with a batch size small enough so that the output batch can fit into memory comfortably.\n\n3. Use tasks to transform batches: To transform batches with tasks, call `map_batches()`. Ray Data uses tasks by default.\n\n4. Handle Torch tensors: Transformations applied with `map` or `map_batches` can return Torch tensors. However, Ray Data automatically converts Torch tensors to NumPy arrays. Subsequent transformations accept NumPy arrays as input, not Torch tensors.\n\n5. Deal with variable-shape tensors: If your tensors vary in shape, Ray Data represents batches as arrays of object dtype. The individual elements of these object arrays are regular ndarrays.\n\nRemember to import the necessary libraries and modules such as `numpy`, `ray`, `pandas`, and `torch` as needed.",

The Ray Serve Autoscaler, an application-level autoscaler, requests Ray to start a specific number of replica actors based on the request demand. If the Ray Autoscaler determines there aren't enough available CPUs for these actors, it requests more Ray nodes. The underlying cloud provider then adds more nodes. The autoscaler only reacts to task and actor resource requests, not application metrics or physical resource utilization. Ray Serve Autoscaling also allows the min_replicas to be 0 when starting your deployment; the scale-up begins when you start sending traffic.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas. This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The parameters include min_replicas, initial_replicas, max_replicas, and target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it tries to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

One possible reason is that the Ray cluster may not be properly set up or initialized. You should use `ray.init(\"ray://<head_node_host>:10001\")` to connect your shell to the cluster. \n\nAnother reason could be that the environment variable RAY_ADDRESS is not defined. You can define an environment variable called RAY_ADDRESS in the same format as the address parameter to connect to an existing cluster with `ray.init()` or `ray.init(address=\u201dauto\u201d)`.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the Dashboard, Dashboard Agent, and GCS may take a few seconds to start up after the head Pod is ready. If you try to connect before these services are up, you might get a \"connection refused\" error.\n\nLastly, ensure that the machine calling `ray up` is not the same machine you are trying to connect to the cluster from, as it will not be considered part of the Ray cluster.",

Secondly, Ray Serve focuses on model composition, allowing for multi-model composition using a programmable API. This makes calls to different models as simple as function calls, even if the models use different resources and run across different machines in the cluster. \n\nIn addition, Ray Serve provides key features for building production-ready machine learning applications, including best-in-class autoscaling and natural integration with business logic. It also allows for flexible scaling up and resource allocation. \n\nAs for why you can't just do it via containers, while containers can be used for deploying models, they may not provide the same level of flexibility, scalability, and ease of use as a dedicated serving layer like Ray Serve. \n\nFinally, because Ray Serve is built on top of Ray, it can run anywhere Ray can, including on your laptop, Kubernetes, any major cloud provider, or even on-premise. This makes it a highly versatile tool for serving machine learning models.",

It is built on top of Ray, so it easily scales to many machines and offers flexible scheduling support such as fractional GPUs so you can share resources and serve many machine learning models at low cost.

Configure your deployments to scale out by increasing the number of deployment replicas and assign replica resources such as CPUs and GPUs.\n\n3. Deploy your Serve application to production on a Ray cluster using the Ray Serve CLI. The command 'serve deploy' takes in a config file path and deploys that file to a Ray cluster over HTTP.

For heavyweight code updates like runtime_env changes, start a new Ray Cluster, update your Serve config file, and deploy the file with 'serve deploy' to the new cluster. Once the new deployment is finished, switch your traffic to the new cluster.\n\n5. At runtime, a deployment consists of a number of replicas, which are individual copies of the class or function that are started in separate Ray Actors (processes). The number of replicas can be scaled up or down (or even autoscaled) to match the incoming request load.\n\nRemember to check for the variable in your environment to make sure you\u2019re using your desired Ray agent address.

            "generated_answer": "The error messages indicate that the worker nodes are being killed due to memory pressure (Out of Memory - OOM). This is likely because the tasks or actors are using more memory than is available on the node. \n\nTo debug this issue, you can:\n\n1. Check the memory usage of your tasks or actors. You can use tools like `top` or `htop` on the node to monitor memory usage. \n\n2. Try reducing the number of workers or the size of the data each worker is handling at a time. \n\n3. If possible, try to optimize your code to use less memory. This could involve things like using more memory-efficient data structures or algorithms, or freeing up memory that's no longer needed.\n\n4. You can also check the logs for more detailed information about the workers killed on the node using the command provided in the error message: `ray logs raylet.out -ip <node-ip>`. This might give you more insight into what's causing the high memory usage.\n\n5. If your tasks or actors are using TensorFlow, you might want to check if TensorFlow is pre-allocating a large amount of memory. By default, TensorFlow maps nearly all of the GPU memory to its process which might cause OOM. You can manage this by allowing TensorFlow to grow the memory usage as is needed by the process or limit the amount of GPU memory that TensorFlow can use.\n\nRemember, debugging is a process of elimination and it might take several attempts to find the root cause of the problem.",

State Management: An actor's instance variables can hold the global state and pass the actor handle to places where the state needs to be modified or accessed. This makes state management easier.\n2.

Flexibility: Tasks are scheduled more flexibly when using actors.\n\nDisadvantages of using singleton Actor:\n1. Limited Support: Using class variables to manage state between instances of the same class is not supported. Each actor instance is instantiated in its own process, so each actor will have its own copy of the class variables.\n2. Overhead: If you don\u2019t need the stateful part of an actor, you\u2019re mostly better off using tasks. This implies that using actors might introduce unnecessary overhead in some cases.",

The 'apply_reduce' function is used in the reduce phase of the MapReduce process, where the j-th return value from each mapper is sent to the j-th reducer. This is done by passing references to the data using Ray objects, which allows for the handling of large datasets that don\u2019t fit on one machine.

This will cancel a workflow but the checkpoints will still be saved in storage. Here is an example:\n\n```python\nfrom ray import workflow\n\n@ray.remote\ndef some_job():\n   return 1\n\nworkflow_task = some_job.bind()\nworkflow.run(workflow_task, workflow_id=\"some_job\")\nworkflow.cancel(workflow_id=\"some_job\")\nassert workflow.get_status(\"some_job\") == workflow.CANCELED\n```\n\nPlease note that these APIs are in alpha and may change before becoming stable.",

This allows for parallelism as multiple operations can be launched in parallel. To get the actual results, you need to call ray.get() on the IDs of the results. This call blocks until the results are available. In async actors, only one task can be running at any point in time. Ray runs all of the methods inside a single Python event loop.

Inside the function, you can print the value of variables to understand the state of your program.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that `ray.get()` is a blocking operation, which means it waits until the requested result is available. If it's called in a loop, the loop will not continue until the `ray.get()` call is resolved. Therefore, it's recommended to avoid calling `ray.get()` in a loop or for intermediate steps. Instead, work with object references directly and only call `ray.get()` at the end to get the final result. \n\nIf your program is still hanging, consider separating the call to `ray.get()` from the call to the remote functions. This allows all remote functions to be spawned before waiting for the results, enabling them to run in parallel in the background.

The key components are a custom resource called a RayCluster that describes the desired state of a Ray cluster, and a custom controller, the KubeRay operator, which manages Ray pods to match the RayCluster\u2019s spec.\n\n2. To deploy a Ray cluster, create a RayCluster custom resource (CR) by applying a configuration file (raycluster.yaml) using the command: `kubectl apply -f raycluster.yaml`.\n\n3. Configure and manage the Ray Dashboard, which is a crucial tool for monitoring and debugging Ray applications and clusters. The configurations may vary depending on how you launch Ray Clusters (e.g., local Ray Cluster v.s. KubeRay). Integrations with Prometheus and Grafana are optional for an enhanced Dashboard experience.\n\n4. Use the RayService for Kubernetes-native support for Ray clusters and Ray Serve applications. After defining a Ray cluster and its Ray Serve applications using a Kubernetes config, you can use `kubectl` to create the cluster and its applications. You can also update the Ray Serve config in the RayService CR config and use `kubectl apply` to update the applications.\n\n5. Use the RayJob for Kubernetes-native support for Ray clusters and Ray jobs. You can define a Ray cluster and job using a Kubernetes config, and use `kubectl` to create them. The cluster can be deleted automatically once the job is finished.\n\n6. Deploy the Ray cluster. The Ray cluster is configured such that one Ray pod will be scheduled per 16-CPU Kubernetes node. This pattern of one Ray pod per Kubernetes node is encouraged, but not required. It is generally more efficient to use a few large Ray pods than many small ones. Review the config file applied in the command before deploying the cluster.",
            "reference_answer": "To manually configure and manage a Ray cluster on Kubernetes, you need to deploy a static Ray cluster into the default namespace. This can be done by applying a sample Ray Cluster from the Ray repo using the command '! kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ray-project/ray/master/doc/source/cluster/kubernetes/configs/static-ray-cluster.with-fault-tolerance.yaml'. The Ray cluster has fault tolerance enabled by default using the external Redis, and you need to set the Redis IP address in the config. Once the Ray cluster has been deployed, you can view the pods for the head node and worker nodes by running '! kubectl get pods'. Wait for the pods to reach the Running state. If your pods are stuck in the Pending state, you can check for errors via 'kubectl describe pod deployment-ray-head-xxxx-xxxxx' and ensure that your Docker resource limits are set high enough.",

            "generated_answer": "The Global Control Service (GCS) server manages cluster-level metadata and provides several cluster-level operations including actor, placement groups, and node management. It is a crucial component of the Ray cluster and runs on the head node. The GCS server is memory-intensive because all the data is stored in-memory. Its failure can cause the entire Ray cluster to fail, hence it requires a significant amount of memory. \n\nThe head node, where the GCS server runs, has more memory-demanding system components such as the GCS or the dashboard. Also, the driver runs from a head node by default. If the head node has the same memory capacity as worker nodes and if you execute the same number of Tasks and Actors from a head node, it can easily have out-of-memory problems. \n\nTo avoid this, you can avoid running any Tasks and Actors on the head node by specifying --num-cpus=0 when starting a head node by ray start --head. Also, tuning the operating system settings can help as all nodes and workers connect to the GCS, creating many network connections that the operating system has to support. \n\nIn addition, when deploying a large cluster, Ray\u2019s architecture means that the head node has extra stress due to additional system processes running on it like GCS. Therefore, a good starting hardware specification for the head node is 8 CPUs and 32 GB memory. The actual hardware specification depends on the workload and the size of the cluster.",

These are the addresses that the head node uses to access Grafana and Prometheus.\n\nIf your head node IP is changing every time you reconfigure your cluster, you might want to consider using a service discovery mechanism or DNS that can dynamically update the IP addresses. This way, you can set the `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` and `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST` to the DNS names instead of the IP addresses, and the DNS will resolve to the current IP of the head node.\n\nFor KubeRay users, you can use Kubernetes' built-in service discovery mechanism.

The 'downscale_smoothing_factor' is used to make the application less sensitive to drops in traffic and scale down more conservatively. The 'upscale_smoothing_factor' is used to quickly scale up resources when there is a high volume of traffic in a short period of time. These factors can be thought of as \"gain\" factors that amplify the response of the autoscaling algorithm.",

There are two types of smoothing factors: `upscale_smoothing_factor` and `downscale_smoothing_factor`. The `upscale_smoothing_factor` can be increased to scale up resources quickly when there is high traffic volume in a short period of time.

You can collect logs written to a pod\u2019s filesystem using one of two logging strategies: sidecar containers or daemonsets. For sidecar containers, you can process logs by configuring a log-processing sidecar for each Ray pod. Ray containers should be configured to share the /tmp/ray directory with the logging sidecar via a volume mount. For daemonsets, you can collect logs at the Kubernetes node level by deploying a log-processing daemonset onto the Kubernetes cluster\u2019s nodes.

For instance, if the memory usage exceeds the threshold of 0.95, Ray might kill the worker causing a spike in CPU usage.\n\n3. Large number of tasks: If there are a large number of tasks running concurrently, it might lead to high CPU usage. For example, if you request resources for 100 tasks and there are already 45 tasks running, the system will try to add enough nodes so that up to 100 tasks can run concurrently, potentially causing a spike in CPU usage.\n\n4. Pinning Object IDs: The operation of pinning object IDs in the NodeManagerService could also contribute to CPU usage.\n\n5. Training iterations: If there are training iterations running, they could also contribute to CPU usage.",
            "reference_answer": "Spikes in node CPU utilization can occur due to the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node. By default, Ray tasks require 1 CPU each and Ray actors require 0 CPU each, so the scheduler limits task concurrency to the available CPUs and actor concurrency to infinite. Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones. Tasks or actors that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM. To manage this, the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node can be reduced by increasing the amount of resources requested by them.",

If there's an issue with the connection, you might see an error like \"Unable to connect to GCS at ...\". You can use tools like nmap or nc to check if each port can be reached from a node.\n\n2. Check the IP address: The worker node might not be able to access the IP address given. You can use the command `ip route get xx.xx.xx.xx` on the worker node to start debugging routing issues.\n\n3. Check the GCS: The Global Control Service (GCS) manages cluster-level metadata. If there's an issue with the GCS, it could cause the health check to fail. By default, the GCS is not fault tolerant since all the data is stored in-memory and its failure means that the entire Ray cluster fails. To make the GCS fault tolerant, HA Redis is required.\n\n4. Check the health check frequency: The frequency at which the controller health checks replicas is set by the \"health_check_period_s\" parameter. If this is set to a low value, it might be causing the health check to fail. You can try increasing this value.\n\n5. Check the node status: You can check the status of the nodes in your cluster. If there are any pending nodes or recent failures, it could indicate an issue with the cluster.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, it might be worth reaching out to the Ray community or support for further assistance.",

If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open).
