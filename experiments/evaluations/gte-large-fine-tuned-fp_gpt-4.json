            "generated_answer": "  Yes, I can help you with that. When using Ray Data's `map_batches` method, you can specify the data type of the output by using the `output_type` parameter.\n\nFor example, if you want to output a PyArrow table, you can set `output_type` to `pyarrow.Table`. If you want to output a dictionary of NumPy arrays, you can set `output_type` to `numpy.ndarray`.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use `map_batches` with `output_type` to output a PyArrow table:\n```\nimport ray\nimport pyarrow as pa\n\n# Create a Ray Data dataset\nds = ray.data.read_csv(\"data.csv\")\n\n# Define a function to transform the data\ndef transform_data(batch):\n    # Do some transformation on the data\n    return batch\n\n# Apply the transformation to the dataset using map_batches\nds = ds.map_batches(transform_data, output_type=pa.Table)\n```\nIn this example, the `transform_data` function takes a batch of data and returns a PyArrow table. The `output_type` parameter is set to `pa.Table` to specify that the output should be a PyArrow table.\n\nYou can also use `output_type` to specify other data types, such as `numpy.ndarray` or `Dict[str, numpy.ndarray]`. For example:\n```\n# Apply the transformation to the dataset using map_batches\nds = ds.map_batches(transform_data, output_type=numpy.ndarray)\n```\nThis will output a dictionary of NumPy arrays, where each key is a column name and each value is a NumPy array containing the data for that column.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
            "reference_answer": "You can specify the batch format in the map_batches() function. If you're working with NumPy ndarrays, your function should accept and return a dictionary of ndarrays. If you're working with pandas DataFrames, your function should accept and return a DataFrame.

The RayService will automatically scale the number of replicas of the application based on the current workload. This allows the application to scale up or down as needed to handle changes in traffic.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas. This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The parameters include min_replicas, initial_replicas, max_replicas, and target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it tries to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

The `ActorPoolStrategy` is created with a size of 10, which means that 10 actors will be created to process the data in parallel across the cluster. The `map_batches` method is used to map the actor over the dataset, and the `take` method is used to print the results.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.util.state.summarize_actors` method to get a summary of the actors in the cluster, which can be useful for debugging and monitoring purposes.",

This method allows you to report intermediate results and checkpoints from the training function (run on distributed workers) up to the Trainer (where your python script is executed). The results will be collected from the distributed workers and passed to the driver to be logged and displayed.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `train.report()` to log the aggregated R2 score and mean train and validation loss from all workers:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.train import Trainer\n\n# Initialize Ray\nray.init()\n\n# Define the training function\ndef train_func(config):\n    # Train the model\n    model = ...\n    # Compute the R2 score and mean train and validation loss\n    r2_score = ...\n    mean_train_loss = ...\n    mean_val_loss = ...\n    # Report the results\n    train.report(r2_score=r2_score, mean_train_loss=mean_train_loss, mean_val_loss=mean_val_loss)\n\n# Create a Trainer\ntrainer = Trainer(backend=\"torch\")\n\n# Train the model\ntrainer.run(train_func, config={...})\n```\nIn this example, the `train_func` function is defined to train a model and compute the R2 score and mean train and validation loss. The `train.report()` method is used to report these results to the Trainer. The Trainer will then aggregate the results from all workers and log them to the tensorboard.\n\nNote that only the results from rank 0 worker will be used. However, in order to ensure consistency, `train.report()` has to be called on each worker.

            "question": "how do I debug why ray rollout workers are deadlocking when using the sample API in `ray/rllib/evaluation/rollout_worker.py`",
            "generated_answer": "  The provided code is a Python script that uses the Ray library to perform a rollout of a reinforcement learning algorithm. The script defines a `SampleBatch` class and a `policy` object, and then uses the `ray` library to create a set of remote workers that perform rollouts in parallel. The script then iterates over the remote workers, gathering samples and improving the policy using the gathered samples.\n\nThe error message you provided suggests that the remote workers are deadlocking when using the `sample` API in `ray/rllib/evaluation/rollout_worker.py`. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as a misconfiguration of the Ray cluster or a bug in the `rollout_worker.py` script.\n\nTo debug this issue, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Check the Ray cluster configuration to ensure that it is properly set up and that the remote workers are able to connect to the cluster.\n2. Check the `rollout_worker.py` script to ensure that it is properly configured and that there are no errors in the code.\n3. Use the `ray.util.ActorPool` class to create a pool of actors that can be used to perform the rollouts in parallel. This can help to ensure that the remote workers are properly utilized and that the deadlocking issue is resolved.\n4. Use the `ray.util.queue.Queue` class to create a queue that can be used to store the samples gathered by the remote workers. This can help to ensure that the samples are properly stored and that the deadlocking issue is resolved.\n5. Use the `ray.nodes` and `ray.cluster_resources` functions to check the status of the Ray cluster and the remote workers. This can help to identify any issues with the Ray cluster or the remote workers that may be causing the deadlocking issue.\n6. Use the `ray.available_resources` function to check the available resources on the Ray cluster and the remote workers. This can help to identify any issues with the resources that may be causing the deadlocking issue.\n7. Use the `ray.util.debugging.get_ray_stacks` function to get the stack traces of the remote workers. This can help to identify any issues with the remote workers that may be causing the deadlocking issue.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to debug the issue and resolve the deadlocking problem in the remote workers.",
            "reference_answer": "To debug why ray rollout workers are deadlocking when using the sample API in `ray/rllib/evaluation/rollout_worker.py`, you can try setting `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` if you encounter errors like `blas_thread_init: pthread_create: Resource temporarily unavailable` when using many workers. You can also check configured system limits with `ulimit -a` for other resource limit errors. For unexpected hangs or performance problems, you can use `ray stack` to dump the stack traces of all Ray workers on the current node, `ray timeline` to dump a timeline visualization of tasks to a file, and `ray memory` to list all object references in the cluster. If you are developing with TensorFlow, it is recommended to use `framework=tf2` and `eager_tracing=True` for maximum performance and support. For debugging purposes, you should use `framework=tf2` with `eager_tracing=False`. All `tf.Tensor` values will then be visible and printable when executing your code.",

We can define a callable class to perform this transformation:\n```\nimport ray\n\nclass ToLower:\n    def __call__(self, row):\n        row[\"text\"] = row[\"text\"].lower()\n        return row\n\n# Create the Dataset\nds = ray.data.read_text(\"s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/this.txt\")\n\n# Apply the transform over the dataset\ntransformed_ds = ds.map(ToLower())\n\n# Print the transformed data\ntransformed_ds.show(3)\n```\nIn this example, we define a callable class `ToLower` that takes a row of data as input, converts the text to lowercase, and returns the transformed row. We then create a Dataset from a text file using `ray.data.read_text`, and apply the `ToLower` transformation to the dataset using `ds.map`. Finally, we print the transformed data using `transformed_ds.show(3)`.\n\nNote that the `ToLower` class is defined as a callable class, which means it has a `__call__` method that takes a row of data as input and returns the transformed row. This allows us to use the `ToLower` class as a callable function in the `ds.map` method.",

This can happen if the actor has a large amount of state that is not explicitly stored in the object store.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try the following:\n\n1. Use tasks instead of actors: If you don't need the stateful part of an actor, you may be better off using tasks. Tasks are simpler and more lightweight than actors, and they don't have the same limitations on state size.\n2. Move the data loader to the training function: Instead of loading the data in the actor's constructor, you can load the data in the training function itself. This will ensure that the data is only loaded when it is needed, and it will not be stored in the actor's state.\n3. Use ray.put() to put large objects in the Ray object store: If you need to store large objects in the actor's state, you can use the ray.put() function to put the objects in the object store. This will allow you to store large objects without running out of memory.\n4. Use an actor pool: If you need to store a large number of actors, you can use an actor pool to manage them. An actor pool is a collection of actors that can be used to perform a specific task. By using an actor pool, you can avoid the overhead of creating and destroying actors for each task.\n5. Use a supervisor actor to manage a tree of actors: If you have a large number of actors that need to be managed, you can use a supervisor actor to manage them. A supervisor actor can delegate tasks to subordinates and handle their failures. This will allow you to simplify the driver code and avoid dealing with failures from worker actors directly.\n6. Force-kill a misbehaving actor: If an actor is misbehaving and cannot be recovered, you can use the ray.kill() function to manually terminate the actor. This will allow you to recover from the failure and continue processing.\n7. Use the ActorPool.push() function to push a new actor into the current list of idle actors: If you need to add a new actor to the actor pool, you can use the ActorPool.push() function to do so. This will allow you to add new actors to the pool without having to create a new pool.\n\nBy following these tips, you should be able to resolve the \"The actor ImplicitFunc is too large\" error and improve the performance of your Ray application.",
            "reference_answer": "To resolve the ValueError: The actor ImplicitFunc is too large, you can use one of the two approaches.

To avoid blocking the program, you can use the asynchronous versions of these functions, `ray.put_async` and `ray.get_async`, which return a future that can be used to retrieve the result later.\n\nAlso, note that `ray.put` and `ray.get` are not the only ways to store and retrieve objects in the object store.

In other words, when you call an instance of a class like a function, Python will automatically look for the `__call__()` method in that class and execute it.\n\nIn the context of Ray data, the `__call__()` method is used to define a function that will be applied to each batch of data in a dataset. This function is typically used for inference, where the model is applied to a batch of input data to produce a batch of output data. By defining the function as `__call__()`, it can be easily used as a callable class, which is useful for defining the function that will be applied to each batch in a dataset.",

            "generated_answer": "  To write unit tests for Ray code, you can use the `unittest` module in Python. Here's an example of how to write a unit test for a Ray function:\n```\nimport unittest\nimport ray\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n\n    def test_ray_function(self):\n        @ray.remote\n        def do_work(x):\n            return x ** x\n\n        result = do_work.remote(2)\n        self.assertEqual(result, 4)\n```\nThis test starts a new Ray cluster with 4 CPUs and 0 GPUs, and then defines a remote function `do_work` that takes an integer `x` and returns `x ** x`. The test then calls the `do_work` function with the argument `2` and asserts that the result is `4`.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.cluster_utils.Cluster` class to create a mini-cluster for testing. This can be useful if you want to test your code in a more realistic environment.\n\nIt's also important to be careful when running tests in parallel, as Ray programs can be a little tricky to test due to the nature of parallel programs. You may need to use the `ray.init(num_cpus=...)` function to fix the resource quantity, or use the `ray.cluster_utils.Cluster` class to create a mini-cluster for testing.",

You can start a new Ray cluster for each test in the setUp method and shut it down in the tearDown method. However, starting and stopping a Ray cluster can add significant latency. To reduce this, you can share the Ray cluster across tests by initializing it in the setUpClass method and shutting it down in the tearDownClass method. Be aware that there are certain cases where it may be unsafe to reuse a Ray cluster across tests, such as if your application depends on setting environment variables per process or if your remote actor/task sets any sort of process-level global variables.",

The `options` method is used to set the `initial_value` parameter to 10 when creating the actor instance.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.get_actor` function to get a handle to a named actor, and then use the `ray.kill` function to kill the actor forcefully.\n\nIt's important to note that actors in Ray are stateful, meaning that they can maintain state between method calls. This can be useful for implementing stateful services, but it also means that you need to be careful when using actors in a distributed system, as the state of the actor can be lost if the actor is killed or if the worker process crashes.",

This method takes an actor as an argument and pushes it into the current list of idle actors.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `ray.util.ActorPool.push`:\n```\nimport ray\nfrom ray.util.actor_pool import ActorPool\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def double(self, v):\n        return 2 * v\n\na1, a2 = Actor.remote(), Actor.remote()\npool = ActorPool([a1])\npool.push(a2)\n```\nIn this example, we define an actor class `Actor` with a method `double` that takes a value `v` and returns twice that value. We then create two instances of the actor, `a1` and `a2`, and push `a2` into the list of idle actors using `pool.push(a2)`.\n\nNote that you can also specify custom resources in `ray_actor_options` when creating an actor, for example to ensure that a deployment is scheduled on a specific node. For example:\n```\n@serve.deployment(ray_actor_options={\"resources\": {\"custom_resource\": 2}})\ndef func(*args):\n    return do_something_with_my_custom_resource()\n```\nIn this example, we specify that the deployment should be scheduled on a node with 2 units of the \"custom_resource\" resource.",

The dashboard is typically exposed on port 8265 of the head node, but this port may not be publicly exposed. To access the dashboard, you can use the `ray dashboard` command to port-forward the dashboard port from the head node to your local machine.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `ray dashboard` command:\n```\n$ ray dashboard -p 8265 cluster.yaml\n```\nThis will port-forward the dashboard port from the head node to your local machine on port 8265. You can then access the dashboard by navigating to `http://localhost:8265` in your web browser.\n\nIf you are using the Ray Cluster Launcher, you can also use the `ray dashboard` command to port-forward the dashboard port automatically. To do this, you can pass the `--dashboard-port` argument with the port number you want to use for the dashboard. For example:\n```\n$ ray dashboard --dashboard-port 8265 cluster.yaml\n```\nThis will port-forward the dashboard port from the head node to your local machine on port 8265, and you can access the dashboard by navigating to `http://localhost:8265` in your web browser.",

            "generated_answer": "  To set the `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` and `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST` variables in the context of KubeRay, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. First, you need to determine the IP address of the head node in your KubeRay cluster. You can do this by running the following command:\n```bash\nkubectl get nodes -o wide\n```\nThis will display a list of all nodes in your cluster, along with their IP addresses.\n2. Next, you need to set the `RAY_GRAFANA_HOST` and `RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST` variables to the IP address of the head node. You can do this by running the following commands:\n```bash\nexport RAY_GRAFANA_HOST=<head_node_ip>\nexport RAY_PROMETHEUS_HOST=<head_node_ip>\n```\nReplace `<head_node_ip>` with the IP address of the head node that you obtained in step 1.\n3.

You can get the node ID or node IP by running the `ray list nodes` command.\n\nHere is an example of how to use these APIs to retrieve a log file from a dead node:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Get the node ID or node IP of the dead node\nnode_id = ray.list_nodes()[0].id\n\n# Retrieve the log file from the dead node\nlog_file = ray.util.state.get_log(node_id=node_id, filename=\"raylet.out\")\n\n# Print the contents of the log file\nprint(log_file.decode(\"utf-8\"))\n```\nNote that these APIs only work for retrieving log files from nodes that are no longer running.

You can collect logs written to a pod\u2019s filesystem using one of two logging strategies: sidecar containers or daemonsets. For sidecar containers, you can process logs by configuring a log-processing sidecar for each Ray pod. Ray containers should be configured to share the /tmp/ray directory with the logging sidecar via a volume mount. For daemonsets, you can collect logs at the Kubernetes node level by deploying a log-processing daemonset onto the Kubernetes cluster\u2019s nodes.

Insufficient resources: If the cluster is running low on resources, such as CPU or memory, it can lead to spikes in CPU utilization as nodes compete for available resources.\n2. Preprocessing compute time: If the preprocessing step of the workload is computationally intensive, adding more CPU-only nodes can help parallelize the preprocessing and reduce CPU utilization.\n3. Memory pressure: If a node is running low on memory, it can lead to spikes in CPU utilization as the node tries to free up memory by killing workers.\n4.

By default, Ray tasks require 1 CPU each and Ray actors require 0 CPU each, so the scheduler limits task concurrency to the available CPUs and actor concurrency to infinite. Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones. Tasks or actors that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM. To manage this, the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node can be reduced by increasing the amount of resources requested by them.",

Check the network connectivity between the nodes in the cluster. Make sure that there are no firewall settings or other network issues that may be preventing the nodes from communicating with each other.\n2. Check the GCS server logs to see if there are any errors or issues that may be causing the health check failures.\n3. If the issue persists, you may need to restart the GCS server or the affected node to see if that resolves the issue.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the error message you provided suggests that the worker node is still up and running, which means that the issue may not be related to the node failure.

If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold.

            "reference_answer": "Ray Core provides a small number of core primitives for building and scaling distributed applications. It allows you to turn your functions and classes into Ray tasks and actors, and work with Ray objects. You can run functions as remote tasks in the cluster by decorating your function with @ray.remote and calling the function with .remote(). Ray also provides actors to parallelize computation across multiple actor instances. When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance of that class in the cluster. This actor can then execute remote method calls and maintain its own internal state. Ray stores task and actor call results in its distributed object store, returning object references that can be later retrieved.",
