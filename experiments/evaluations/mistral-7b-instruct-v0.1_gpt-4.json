We then compile the model with the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss. We define two data generators for training and validation, and an early stopping callback to stop training if the validation loss does not improve for three epochs. We also define a learning rate reduction callback to reduce the learning rate if the validation loss does not improve for three epochs. Finally, we define a model checkpoint callback to save the best model checkpoint based on the validation loss.\n\nAfter training the model, we create a `TensorflowCheckpoint` object from the trained model using the `from_model` method. This checkpoint object can be used to restore the model and preprocessor from a checkpoint file.",

We then pickle the `actor` instance using the `pickle` module and save it to a file called `actor.pickle`.\n\nFinally, we load the `actor` instance from the file and call the `f` method to verify that it works as expected.",

This function takes in the results from each actor, and reduces them into a single output by adding up all word occurrences. The 'apply_reduce' function is used in the reduce phase of the MapReduce process, where the j-th return value from each mapper is sent to the j-th reducer. This is done by passing references to the data using Ray objects, which allows for the handling of large datasets that don\u2019t fit on one machine. The final result is a dictionary of word counts, which is then sorted and printed.",

We're then using the `assertEqual` method from the `unittest` module to check that the result is what we expect.\n\nIt's important to note that when testing Ray programs, it's safest to start a new Ray cluster for each test.

            "question": "what doess the GCS server do, and why is my GCS server taking up so much memory on the head node?",
            "generated_answer": " The GCS server is a centralized metadata server for a Ray cluster that runs on the Ray head node. It manages node membership and actor directory, and is also known as the Global Control Store. The head node is a node that runs extra cluster-level processes like GCS and API server in addition to those processes running on a worker node.\n\nThe GCS server takes up so much memory on the head node because it is a centralized component that many other components in Ray communicate with. When you see an error message related to too many open files, it is recommended to adjust the max file descriptors limit per process via the ulimit command. The recommended value is 65536.\n\nThe Ray head node has more memory-demanding system components such as GCS or the dashboard, and also runs the driver from a head node by default. If the head node has the same memory capacity as worker nodes and if you execute the same number of Tasks and Actors from a head node, it can easily have out-of-memory problems. In this case, it is recommended to not run any Tasks and Actors on the head node by specifying --num-cpus=0 when starting a head node by ray start --head.\n\nTuning Operating System Settings is also important because all nodes and workers connect to the GCS, many network connections will be created and the operating system has to support that number of connections. The head node needs to open several more ports in addition to the ports specified above.\n\nWhen deploying a large cluster, Ray's architecture means that the head node has extra stress due to additional system processes running on it like GCS. A good starting hardware specification for the head node is 8 CPUs and 32 GB memory. The actual hardware specification depends on the workload and the size of the cluster. Metrics that are useful for deciding the hardware specification are CPU usage, memory usage, and network bandwidth usage. Make sure the head node has sufficient bandwidth. The most heavily stressed resource on the head node is outbound bandwidth.\n\nTo add fault tolerance to Ray's Global Control Store (GCS), you can deploy your Serve application with KubeRay. By default, the Ray head node is a single point of failure: if it crashes, the entire Ray cluster crashes and must be restarted. When running on Kubernetes, the RayService controller health-checks the Ray cluster and restarts it if this occurs, but this introduces some downtime.",

Experiment with insufficient resources: You can experiment with a Kubernetes cluster with an 8-CPUs node and the ray-service.insufficient-resources.yaml file to reproduce the situation.\n3. Restart the Ray cluster: You can restart the Ray cluster without running any of the installation commands using the command `ray up CLUSTER.YAML --restart-only`.\n4. Wait for the pods to reach the Running state: After restarting the Ray cluster, wait for the pods to reach the Running state. This may take a few minutes.\n5. Check for errors: If the pods are stuck in the Pending state, you can check for errors via `kubectl describe pod raycluster-kuberay-xxxx-xxxxx` and ensure that your Docker resource limits are set high enough.\n6. Check the Ray cluster address: After the Ray cluster is up and running, you can check the Ray cluster address using the command `ray status` or by checking the logs of the Ray head node using `kubectl logs ${RAYCLUSTER_HEAD_POD}`.\n7.

You can collect logs written to a pod\u2019s filesystem using one of two logging strategies: sidecar containers or daemonsets. For sidecar containers, you can process logs by configuring a log-processing sidecar for each Ray pod. Ray containers should be configured to share the /tmp/ray directory with the logging sidecar via a volume mount. For daemonsets, you can collect logs at the Kubernetes node level by deploying a log-processing daemonset onto the Kubernetes cluster\u2019s nodes.

In this case, the spike in CPU utilization is likely due to the node running low on memory, which caused the task to be killed.

By default, Ray tasks require 1 CPU each and Ray actors require 0 CPU each, so the scheduler limits task concurrency to the available CPUs and actor concurrency to infinite. Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones. Tasks or actors that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM. To manage this, the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node can be reduced by increasing the amount of resources requested by them.",

If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold.
