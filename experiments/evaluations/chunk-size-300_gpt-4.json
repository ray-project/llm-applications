To configure autoscaling, you can use the Ray cluster launcher.",

The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider.

It has several features and performance optimizations for serving Large Language Models such as response streaming, dynamic request batching, multi-node/multi-GPU serving, etc. Ray Serve is particularly well suited for model composition and many model serving, enabling you to build a complex inference service consisting of multiple ML models and business logic all in Python code. It is built on top of Ray, so it easily scales to many machines and offers flexible scheduling support such as fractional GPUs so you can share resources and serve many machine learning models at low cost.

This class allows you to specify the number of retries and the delay between retries.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `FailureConfig` to retry a trial up to 3 times with a 10-second delay between retries:\n```\nfrom ray import train, tune\n\n# Define the trial\ndef my_trial(config):\n    # ...\n\n# Configure the failure settings\nfailure_config = tune.FailureConfig(\n    max_retries=3,\n    retry_delay=10,\n)\n\n# Run the trial with Tune\ntune.run(\n    my_trial,\n    config={\n        # ...\n    },\n    failure_config=failure_config,\n)\n```\nIn this example, the `my_trial` function is defined as a trial, and the `failure_config` object is passed to the `tune.run` function to configure the failure settings. The `max_retries` parameter specifies the maximum number of retries, and the `retry_delay` parameter specifies the delay between retries.\n\nWhen a trial fails, Ray Tune will automatically retry it up to the specified number of retries, with the specified delay between retries. If the trial still fails after the maximum number of retries, it will be considered a failed trial and will not be retried further.",

This class automatically initializes the Wandb API with Tune's training information, and you can use the Wandb API like you would normally do, e.g. using `wandb.log()` to log your training process.\n\nHere's an example of how to use `WandbLoggerCallback` with AccelerateTrainer:\n```python\nfrom tune.logger import WandbLoggerCallback\n\n# Initialize the WandbLoggerCallback\nwandb_logger = WandbLoggerCallback(\n    project=\"my_project\",\n    entity=\"my_entity\",\n    api_key=\"my_api_key\",\n    config={\"epochs\": 10, \"batch_size\": 32}\n)\n\n# Initialize the AccelerateTrainer\ntrainer = AccelerateTrainer(\n    model=model,\n    optimizer=optimizer,\n    loss_fn=loss_fn,\n    train_loader=train_loader,\n    val_loader=val_loader,\n    callbacks=[wandb_logger]\n)\n\n# Train the model\ntrainer.fit()\n```\nIn this example, we initialize the `WandbLoggerCallback` with the project name, entity name, and API key for Wandb. We also pass in the training configuration as a dictionary.\n\nWe then initialize the `AccelerateTrainer` with the model, optimizer, loss function, and data loaders. We also pass in the `WandbLoggerCallback` as a callback.\n\nFinally, we call the `fit()` method on the `AccelerateTrainer` to train the model. The `WandbLoggerCallback` will automatically log the training process to Wandb.",

We then define a `setUp` method that initializes the Ray cluster with 4 CPUs and 0 GPUs.\n\nWe then define a `test_ray_function` method that tests a Ray function. In this method, we use the `ray.get` function to retrieve the output of a remote Ray function that multiplies a number by 2. We then use the `ray.get` function again to retrieve the output of another remote Ray function that multiplies a number by 3. We then use the `self.assertEqual` method to check that the output of the first function is equal to the output of the second function.\n\nNote that this is just an example, and you will need to modify it to test your specific Ray code. Additionally, you may need to use other testing frameworks or libraries, such as `pytest` or `nose`, to write your unit tests.",

To reduce this, you can share the Ray cluster across tests by initializing it in the setUpClass method and shutting it down in the tearDownClass method.

For example:\n```\nray_job = RayJob(timeout_s=300)\n```\nThis will set the timeout for the Ray job to 300 seconds (5 minutes).\n\nAlternatively, you can set the `timeout_s` parameter in the `HorovodConfig` or `TorchConfig` constructor, depending on the type of job you are running. For example:\n```\nhorovod_config = HorovodConfig(timeout_s=300)\n```\nThis will set the timeout for the Horovod job to 300 seconds (5 minutes).\n\nYou can also set the `timeout_s` parameter in the `Serve` constructor to set the end-to-end timeout for HTTP requests. For example:\n```\nserve = Serve(timeout_s=300)\n```\nThis will set the timeout for HTTP requests to 300 seconds (5 minutes).\n\nNote that the `timeout_s` parameter is only available in Ray 1.10 and later versions. In earlier versions of Ray, you can use the `ray.get_timeout` function to set the timeout for a Ray task.

If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold.
