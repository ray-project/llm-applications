In the case of PPO, each worker collects samples 'rollout_fragment_lenth' samples in 'num_env_per_workers'. And there are 'num_workers' number of workers. So, this sampling stage produces a train (full) batch, which is then divided into smaller mini batches, each of which is in the size of 'sgd_minibatch_size'. And then a minibatch is randomly selected, which is used to update the value and policy network. This update stage is iterated 'num_sgd_iter' times. These all stages occur in one (algorithm) iteration. And the next iteration starts with new sampling stage without using any sample collected in the previous step. This is the data collection and how they are used in the PPO training. I just want to know such cases in SAC in RLlib.", "target": 0}
