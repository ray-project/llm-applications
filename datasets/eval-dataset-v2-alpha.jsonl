Input and output blocks consume both worker heap memory and shared memory via Ray\u2019s object store. Ray Data attempts to bound its heap memory usage to num_execution_slots * max_block_size. The number of execution slots is by default equal to the number of CPUs, unless custom resources are specified. The maximum block size is set by the configuration parameter ray.data.DataContext.target_max_block_size and is set to 512MiB by default. When a task\u2019s output is larger than this value, the worker automatically splits the output into multiple smaller blocks to avoid running out of heap memory. Large block size can lead to potential out-of-memory situations. To avoid these issues, make sure no single item in your Ray Data is too large, and always call ds.map_batches() with batch size small enough such that the output batch can comfortably fit into memory.\"", "source": "https://docs.ray.io/en/master/data/data-internals.html"}
