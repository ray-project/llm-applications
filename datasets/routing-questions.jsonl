In the case of PPO, each worker collects samples 'rollout_fragment_lenth' samples in 'num_env_per_workers'. And there are 'num_workers' number of workers. So, this sampling stage produces a train (full) batch, which is then divided into smaller mini batches, each of which is in the size of 'sgd_minibatch_size'. And then a minibatch is randomly selected, which is used to update the value and policy network. This update stage is iterated 'num_sgd_iter' times. These all stages occur in one (algorithm) iteration. And the next iteration starts with new sampling stage without using any sample collected in the previous step. This is the data collection and how they are used in the PPO training. I just want to know such cases in SAC in RLlib."}

I saw the training result says reward nan for the first few runs of the training. And then some value was shown in the training status. Is this because just the episode length was too long?

For Parquet in particular, reading Parquet datasets partitioned by a particular column is supported, allowing for path-based (zero-read) partition filtering and (optionally) including the partition column value specified in the file paths directly in the read table data. For the NYC taxi dataset, instead of reading individual per-month Parquet files, we can read the entire 2009 directory. Warning This could be a lot of data (downsampled with 0.01 ratio leads to ~50.2 MB on disk, ~147 MB in memory), so be careful triggering full reads on a limited-memory machine! This is one place where Dataset\u2019s lazy reading comes in handy: Dataset will not execute any read tasks eagerly and will execute the minimum number of file reads to satisfy downstream operations, which allows us to inspect a subset of the data without having to read the entire dataset."}

This way, the flags passed into python my_ray_server.py --my-flags can be recognized. \u2022 However, these flags are not passed into serve.deployment actors, and the current workaround is to set the default values in flags.py but it's very inflexible. Of course, I can use other tricks like env variables, or config files to keep the flags in sync among all handles/actors. I'm wondering if there is any recommended way of solving this problem."}
